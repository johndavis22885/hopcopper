There does not seem to be anything in the books yet to justify the current low price but the price did drop below some newsletter stop losses a while back so there would have been some selling from that.

This month five years ago it was 26500 yuan.That of.The year 2011 marked the peak of the rare earths bubble a price explosion that transformed an esoteric section of the chemical table into front-page news.It was a bubble made exclusively in China the world’s dominant producer across the full spectrum of rare earth metals.The country had imposed an export tariff and quota system on its exports in 2009 sending shock waves down a global manufacturing chain which had become increasingly dependent on these weird and wonderful metals for everything from mobile phones to nuclear fuel rods.A World Trade Organisation case found against China in 2014 and the country eliminated all export quotas last year.But by that time the boom had already turned to bust. Collective thrifting and hoarding by buyers saw demand disappear while illegal smuggling of rare earths across China’s porous northwestern borders went into overdrive.The latter remains a key dampener on prices which are back at pre-boom levels.Chinese authorities have this year launched a new crackdown on illegal mining and have announced a new stockpiling scheme to support the country’s own official producers many of which are piling up losses.Rare earths supply has still not recovered from the excesses of 2009-2011.China is still struggling to control its own black market which is undermining Beijing’s stated aim of becoming a global power-house in materials that feed into a host of evolving technologies.Now Honda and Daido have just delivered a tail-wind demand shock to those ambitions.The common assumption is that rare earths are irreplaceable in many of their uses.Not so apparently.AndStarting next month Daido Electronics will begin the mass-production and shipment of the new magnet from a new production line at its plant in Nakatsugawa City in Gifu Prefecture.Honda “will continue expanding application of this technology to new models in the future.”These are relatively new metallic raw materials but the salutary lesson from the story is an old one.If producers push prices to excess there will be a demand payback even if it takes several years to take concrete form.Other new-age material suppliers such as those of lithium another market where prices are starting to bubble should take note.Sorry couldn't help but bold a few bits in the lite weight propaganda piece but it does make quite a interesting contrast to Jack's  heavies  BS.","More lite weight C&P stuff","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/more-lite-weight-c-p-stuff.2813516/?post_id=18283730","97","1","15/07/16","23:36:21","7.1¢","Sell","Not Held"

Effectively Christ flesh brings God's Word and out of Christ's mouth it came as Christ says it was. So it wasn't the word (God) in John 1:1 that came flesh. It was God's words = Christ. Stop and think he came into Mary through God's plans words delivered by the angel = God's command via words. So some where in the past he came via God like manor one would have to say.Get over into Malachi I think it is You will see reference there of John for the purpose of making the way/path foras God was anticipating sending his Son. Pat of making the way was mentioning the one that was coming prepping.  John was  baptizing to the  Father  with water first until after the flesh 14 and now flesh at 15 then he was baptizing through Christ why the bleepers can't people see thatand the other Gospels. Yes we know while he was baptizing to the Father he was mentioning of the one that was coming after = coming and not there yet so in the mean time I'm baptizing the old way with water. John didn't personally know him as outlined in 1:31.Yes Christ was preferred he is the center of God's foreknown plans and John knew full well of this fact. He was the before John obviously in Spiritual form but not on the scene in flesh until 14. Still the mystery so to speak.After around 1:17 it then gives a more fuller account of John and then the main subject Jesus which then picks up effectively as the other Gospels. Before then it gives a brief from whence all began and from whom all comes (God) and the way to God before Christ and then Christ comes into the picture as I said at 14.God is the true light as all life comes from God. Christ became the light of the world after the flesh he says so himself further in John.There are two things that I have concern with your belief and for you ATM = The Holy Spirit is God's Spirit he is Spirit and that is him. And the other you appear to play down the significance of God and His word. Yes His spirit is the power etc but it is Him. The spirit of God etc and is and can be everywhere.John doesn't say the  Word  is coming after him it was the Christ.John bare witness of him at 15 but not baptizing to him yet.Oh and yes it will be hard or near on impossible to consider another view.John 1:1 wording  is  correct you can't imply a term.I'm not being judgmental I just care.","Re: The Word","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/the-word.2813493/page-7?post_id=18283727","175","","15/07/16","23:35:19","","",""

Satan will not be ruling over hell nor his minions for this is as much a judgement on the angelic beings as it is for mankind. Then He will also say to those on His left 'Depart from Me accursed ones into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;God will be in control but in the lake of fire God will remove his common grace that all creation delights in good and evil but there are those that  refuse to acknowledge and some today who cannot understand why good things happen to bad people and vice versa. This removal of common grace alone is such a profoundly frightful thought.so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.There will be no presence of his glory for those who are in hell it will be a feeble and dark existence as those who rejected God have nothing but their own hearts desires to draw upon. Throw out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.Satan will rage in the fire but he is just an angel probably the greatest creature in existence but he can not create only God creates. He will impotent in his anger for he will have nothing good left in creation to vent his hatred toward his mouth will be full of dust as the serpent he has become. So too will the wicked rage in their anger the frustration that there is nothing for the rebel to fight against but their own hearts desires. What will become of evil then? It will be horrific to see Satan the light bearer a magnificent creature cast in the depths of the abyss but evil will not be victorious it will be crushed on judgement day.The wicked will see it and be vexed He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked will perish.For the rebel to know what they have thrown away. The regret and anger because they rejected God it will be unimaginable pain of loss.There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham Isaac Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God but you yourselves are thrown out.Will there be torment certainly but God does not have to directly intervene in a sense of directly punishing an individual or group of people God can just remove his support and that occurs in a profound way in hell the exact opposite to the righteous life in heaven.…8in blazing fire. He will inflict vengeance on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 9The gates of hell in effect are not locked from the outside but from within so the casting into the lake is achieved by reaching the finishing post in life as a successful rebel. Those that go to their grave rejecting Christ and in rebellion to God will not be arguing their innocence in Hades while waiting for their judgement day.They will be convicted by their guilt because just as the rich man when seeing Lazarus from afar begged for comfort but did not try to argue his innocence or claim his soul will now change because he found himself in this predicament. Death does not provide a reset button on the soul of the sinner and his sin against the eternal God and his rejection of the eternal God will be honored.In Revelation 14:10-11 we read in the presence but does that mean God is part of the lake? Obviously not that would be pantheism God is the creator not the creation but the word used is enopion which means proximity but not intimate association although God is in control it is not Satan's new kingdom to rule he has removed his protective hand emptying hell of his glory just as Jesus emptied himself as an act of humility to become a man and redeem his people. Although Jesus emptied himself of some of his attributes he was still fully God and fully man.For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily formGod will not have his presence in hell like the reprobate does not have the presence of the Holy Spirit indwelling but judgement will be final.he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; they have no rest day and night those who worship the beast and his image and whoever receives the mark of his name. Time requires matter to exist. Will heaven consist of matter? and if not then there will be no time as we know it.What will heaven resemble? it may resemble our current creation but will it be the same matter that we can hold in our hands with our fleshy bodies today probably not.The material of the wall was jasper; and the.","Re: Hell -just another myth?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/hell-just-another-myth.2798683/page-76?post_id=18284015","2382","","16/07/16","02:25:40","","",""

When is a newbie not a newbie?First and worse trade was LWP (CKK): in at .007 and .012; out at .005. Took some off the table at .013 but not significantly. To make matters worse I went all in but only with what I could afford mostly....Havn't yet recovered financially. Mentally don't give a rats a; am blessed with a lack of desire for anything fiscal. Maybe it's not such a blessing for trading as it provides for some careless buying but also enables to cut losses quickly; the silver lining.On our other weekend topic the LWP thread has provided a class act over the months from some respected posters in the art of down-ramping; of course IMO. But possibly here this weekend we have an opportunity for them to contribute to this important topic by clarifying their position all for the sake of educating us lesssouls whom have not yet learnt the finer nuances of trading psychology.Before leaving myifeillass mis-adventures it can't go without mention their latest endeavor the graphene battery! Now whether or not we all awake one day to find that it has replaced the Li-iron battery is something only a betting man would gamble on. But since my trading style so far remarkably resembles the I will put a smallish wager on it but only when I'm back in front. That in itself though is quite a gamble.Lastly on the stock whose name should not be mentioned too often it occurred to me that it must have traded the most volume than any other this last year; easily. How to confirm or rebuke?Best trade was PSF: in at .017 out at .047 with some skimming prior to suspension. It all begins again on Wednesday so don't forget your best hat and looking glass and head on down to the track. All on green as in G.

Let me be as blunt and direct as I can be. Western civilization is in a war. We should frankly test every person here who is of a Muslim background and if they believe in Sharia they should be deported  Gingrich said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity.  Sharia is incompatible with Western civilization. Modern Muslims who have given up Sharia glad to have them as citizens. Perfectly happy to have them next door. His remarks came in light of awhere a large truck plowed through a crowd killing as many as 80 people. How do we ascertain -- how do you possibly ascertain whether or not that person really wants assimilation really wants a new life or whether or not they want to expand that caliphate which is what we're at war against?  Hannity asked. The first step is you have to ask them the questions  Gingrich responded.  The second step is you have to monitor what they're doing on the Internet. The third step is let me be very clear you have to monitor the mosques. I mean if you're not prepared to monitor the mosques this whole thing is a joke. Where do you think the primary source of recruitment is? Where do you think the primary place of indoctrination is? You've got to look at the madrassas -- if you're a school which is teaching Sharia you want to expel it from the country. Read MoreThe comments by Gingrich -- who was a finalist to be Donald Trump's running mate before the real estate mogulon Thursday -- are similar to ones when he called for surveillance of  certain mosques  to counter terrorist threats.Gingrich also said Thursday that calling Islam a  religion of peace  is  bologna.  It's not that Islamists are necessarily evil but they're not necessarily a religion of peace  Gingrich said.Gingrich then turned his focus to President Barack Obama citing many leading Democrats' argument for stricter gun regulation laws after where 49 individuals where shot and killed inside a nightclub. I fully expect by tomorrow morning that President Obama will have rediscovered his left-wing roots and will give a press conference in which he'll explain that the problem is too many trucks  Gingrich said.  If only we had truck regulation then we wouldn't have problems like Nice because it is trucks that are dangerous. I mean that's the exact analog to Orlando and just tells you how nuts the left wing in America is. Gingrich was also asked about Trump's decision to select Pence as his running mate. The former House speaker acknowledged it appeared the Indiana governor was the choice but said  I've not been officially told.

Naturally he's made a lot of moneyfrom gullible customers.There's a multitude of articles on the Net which debunk this figment but afterwading through many I've picked the following for it's readability and coverageof most points. I don't endorse the group that publishes this article (or any othergroup) but I can't fault this particular piece except like some other  Churchesthey think it's theirs that will be protected--someone's going to be very unhappy.There is a group of people who are specifically promised protection during the3 1/2 years of Tribulation in Revelation Ch 12. The 'woman' mentioned is obviouslyIsrael but some groups (including the article's publisher) believe this woman morphsinto the Church (their Church of course)  The term 'woman' has been used in the Bibleto represent a Church in some places. Some think the woman riding the Beast inRev. is a well known powerful Church lording it over an endtime World ruling power.It could well be that the woman in Ch 12 does represent the/a Church but if we go backto Ch. 7 we find 144000 lucky people who are sealed/protected 12000 from each ofthe 12 tribes of Israel. Is this the same group which is mentioned in Ch. 7? Who knowsbut if we zoom forward to Ch. 14 we find the 144000 mentioned again with the returned Christ.This is only one part though of how the Rapture lie has been promoted and unfortunatelyas per usual most Christians don't bother to do any research on the subject they just goalong blindly believing whatever some man tells them is true. They really are 'asleep'.Anyway let the reader make up their own mind. No doubt we will have to endure more'opinions' from some who think they know it all when in fact they know nothing of anyreal value relating to this life or the next.Cheers.","The Rapture-another myth?.","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/the-rapture-another-myth.2813486/?post_id=18283223","45","1","15/07/16","21:12:51","","",""

Although the timing caught the participants a bit by surprise the ‘give away’ price accepted by COP was equally odd. It doesnt surprise me too much as once a major has decided to ‘out’ something timing is usually more important than value. Where COP will look even more foolish is when commerciality is declared fairly soon I think and when one or more of the other parties increase their resource estimates also fairly soon. For Cairn who have how you say been quite slow off the mark to appreciate value here they will lose operatorship to WPL but gain as the development gets going much more quickly. For Far still massively geared to the discovery the upside despite being dented yesterday still looks huge. They are fully funded for anything that can be thrown at them two wells this year perhaps and plenty of technical and administrative work to do into the bargain. Despite being caught by surprise I still think upside in Far can be well above 25c a share.","Re: Malcy on FAR/CNE","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/malcy-on-far-cne.2813215/page-6?post_id=18283000","2180","17","15/07/16","20:34:17","7.7¢","Hold","Held"

This month five years ago it was 26500 yuan.That of dysprosium again according to Mysteel has fallen from 15500 yuan per kg to 1650 over the same period.The year 2011 marked the peak of the rare earths bubble a price explosion that transformed an esoteric section of the chemical table into front-page news.It was a bubble made exclusively in China the world’s dominant producer across the full spectrum of rare earth metals.The country had imposed an export tariff and quota system on its exports in 2009 sending shock waves down a global manufacturing chain which had become increasingly dependent on these weird and wonderful metals for everything from mobile phones to nuclear fuel rods.A World Trade Organisation case found against China in 2014 and the country eliminated all export quotas last year.But by that time the boom had already turned to bust. Collective thrifting and hoarding by buyers saw demand disappear while illegal smuggling of rare earths across China’s porous northwestern borders went into overdrive.The latter remains a key dampener on prices which are back at pre-boom levels.Chinese authorities have this year launched a new crackdown on illegal mining and have announced a new stockpiling scheme to support the country’s own official producers many of which are piling up losses.Rare earths supply has still not recovered from the excesses of 2009-2011.China is still struggling to control its own black market which is undermining Beijing’s stated aim of becoming a global power-house in materials that feed into a host of evolving technologies.Now Honda and Daido have just delivered a tail-wind demand shock to those ambitions.The common assumption is that rare earths are irreplaceable in many of their uses.Not so apparently.And not only have the Japanese companies worked out how to design two rare earth metals out of electric motors but they have reduced costs by around 10% and weight by around 8% in doing so.Starting next month Daido Electronics will begin the mass-production and shipment of the new magnet from a new production line at its plant in Nakatsugawa City in Gifu Prefecture.Honda “will continue expanding application of this technology to new models in the future.”Good news for the neodymium market. Less good news for the terbium and dysprosium markets.These are relatively new metallic raw materials but the salutary lesson from the story is an old one.If producers push prices to excess there will be a demand payback even if it takes several years to take concrete form.Other new-age material suppliers such as those of lithium another market where prices are starting to bubble should take note.","Lynas a big winner with Honda hybrid engine breakthrough","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/lynas-a-big-winner-with-honda-hybrid-engine-breakthrough.2813458/?post_id=18282707","526","11","15/07/16","19:43:41","7.6¢","Buy","Held"

The broker looked and me and asked if I new what I was doing and that I should buy a company called BHP.He said he wouldn't buy them for me unless I would put my $1500 on the counter and let him set fire to it..... ha ha......  I had been thinking about this after watching the prices in the paper for weeks.Now was the time! Quick as a flash I threw the dollars  on the counter.About a month later I sold them for a 67% return.After thinking about what he had said to me I could see some beginners luck involved here so on my next foray I thought I would get into banking.

I am not against teaching or being taught but with all the different takes in the world I would advise do your own homework. EVERYONE needs to digest how the Angle of light WILL slip in wherever he can and where you least expect. And boy I reckon he has picked John 1:1......(That one I personally can couch for). John 14:13-14 is worth a look at and there are others.Prior to seeking the truth among other things believe every bit of this following verse or don't bother asking -So seeking God's truth will certainly lead to Glorifying the Father and Christ.Now the above is all well and good but one  has to  have the true connection to start with to= full understanding. Without you get some but not all and you would have to hope you don't fall under 2 Thes 2:11 and believe lies. Not saying I am the only one or I am this or that what I say here applies to us  all . I would recommend fully grasping and digesting 1 Cor Ch 2. This makes it very clear how and where wisdom knowledge and understanding should and does come from.The moment someone tries to suggest reading this or that = Man's Bibles (not God's) the barriers go up instantly for me as God condemns/against these essays of man of the world.From a few of your posts it appears you often rely on this type of thing from JW's that would bother me!You may not wish to answer but did you find the JW belief of your own self or were you lead taught it?","Re: Hell -just another myth?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/hell-just-another-myth.2798683/page-67?post_id=18282291","2382","","15/07/16","18:38:24","","",""

US$150m ($117.4m for the 9.545% and then about $31m for that share of my est of US$300m to get to FID.2) Second level. Min level plus buy an additional 5.55% off CNE.  This would give FAR 30.1%.  This would then mean that WPL would have 25.454% CNE with 34.45%.  This is VERY important because at this level neither WPL nor CNE can gang up on FAR.  This is because the CRITICAL JV voting % is 60 % (not 50% as some believe).  This means that both partners HAVE to ask FAR to do anything in the JV.  Any % below this and WPL and CNE can continue to have their own club and not pay attention to FAR.  So add an additional US$87m for this one bringing the new total to US$237m.3) Third level.  Whatever it takes to get the Operatorship.  I have no idea whether this is even possible so US$??m.But the above is only if FAR chooses the consortia/Investor path.  It would be different if they chose a Big Oil daddy strategy who would likely aim for the operatorship and slip FAR a few cheap % points.So is  US$237m possible?  Hell yeah.   I'm sure there are existing instos (Farjoy) and specialty fund groups who would jump at the chance.

I sold all my holdings for a nice profit when it hit its highs and then bought back immediately the next day. I've been buying since and now have enough. My personal challenge is being patient and believing all the facts but also having confidence that facts and fundamentals will be enough to make PLS' share price rise.

Zinc touched US$1.00 a pound on Thursday for the first time since mid-2015 while nickel jumped to a nine-month high of US$4.73 a pound. Zinc is up 48 per cent from its January low and nickel is up 38 per cent in the same period.These moves were a long time coming. For the past two years experts have been warning of major supply-side problems in these markets and predicting that rallies were inevitable. It took a while for them to materialize in part because of high inventories. And now that they are finally here there is debate about whether they are sustainable.No one should think the current prices are great ones. At US$1.00 zinc is still only half the value it reached at its peak in 2007. Nickel meanwhile topped out at US$24 that same year. It is just a tiny fraction of that today.There is a little more optimism about zinc. The market has been in deficit for the last couple of years which has whittled down inventories. And the deficits are likely to get bigger. Several of the world’s largest zinc mines have closed in recent years and there is no major source of supply coming on to replace them. Melek said a supply shortfall of around 400000 tonnes is likely in 2016 followed by a shortfall of 500000 tonnes in 2017.There are concerns that hidden zinc inventories could materialize (a big problem in recent years) and that demand will be weaker than expected. The market is also simply due for a pullback. But overall there is some optimism that this long-awaited rally is for real.“If I were comparing nickel to zinc I’d be much happier to get long zinc at this point” Melek said.","Re: Zinc on a strong footing","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/zinc-on-a-strong-footing.2775835/page-56?post_id=18281980","5555","1","15/07/16","17:44:03","","",""

Most large retailers have already sorted their shelf space and Christmas stock due to lead times so if it isn't locked in ? and it then comes down to production etc etc.  Not sure the level of groundwork already done but it isn't a simple or quick job to get stuff into them and there is whole manuals of how to supply Walmart for example and the process of their buyers reviewing goods .  They check accounts of suppliers and manufactures and minimum limits are set .  I don't believe they sub that out to anyone but they do have preferred distributors but even they are guaranteed .  They do leave some space for late release products but usually from majors or cult items ..It is a massive job and expense to stock a national chain store  .   Then once in store there is a whole range of hurdles you have to meet to keep your product in store including IOT or distributor keeping up suitable promotion and social media presence to keep the product moving.   Walmart is 4000 plus stores but generally they will trial some with a lot of products and then do a rollout to suitable stores but not sure how they do electronics coming up to Christmas.I honestly don't think unless they are in it to pump a stock that they would have the right to announce a major retailer as it might be good for shareholders egos but may be very poor timing in regard to marketing etc.	It is a mixed bag doing it and vice versa at the current time if they were able to secure something.  Reality they have gun for hire distributor it seems and they will try and push it where they can .IF IOT can't show massive preorders and social media interest ( walmart have masses of market data and business marketing  analysts ) I think they will struggle on wholesale pricing and the campaign to date has IMO not bee outstanding in generating vibe across social media platforms but  has been a bit in financial forums like HC but it is now coming down to facts not speculation hence the price IMO.  That can change in a minute if they actually come through and get good sales good reviews and start keeping to timeline and specs they suggest initially.Just which mates got allocated - get teh register and be sure and get broker data to see if it has gone to safe hands or is it just going to be churned.IF someone was really interested in IOT shares and if the issue didn't go to secure hands they could easily shake teh tree and push this lower and pick em up as a lot of sophs require a quick turn around and don't fall in love with stocks. They probably did well on the previous run up so if they take a loss - so be it - that's business.So are we seeing a  controlled sell by bored sophs  just a lack of interest waiting for news or slow shake out to see if issue went to secure hands?","Re: Opposition to Roam-e?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/opposition-to-roam-e.2811676/page-134?post_id=18281579","16070","2","15/07/16","16:50:21","6.9¢","None","Not Held"

I have also had LEG on the radar.Let me share a few thoughts:It is truly amazing the spin the media can put on things - in this case they either got carried away themselves or they may have themselves fallen victim to the misinformation from either the company itself or Brett Rankin.A bit of research:Brett Rankin is the former director of Outer-Rim Exploration Services () that has since gone belly up owing plenty to creditors and employees.See here:The new technique they are using is not exactly new.The yellow box on the ground is a Crone geophysical receiver. h) and according to Crone  The PEM system has been in use since the early 1970’s . There you have it - the 'innovative' gear is actually antiquated.Quite probably the probe that is being used for the down-hole survey is a coil-sensor that is equally antiquated. The crone coil is also hopeless at detecting strong conductors (like the Nova nickel deposit); In fact the stronger the conductor is  the harder it is for a Crone coil to see it. The rest of the geophysical world has moved-on to real innovative surveys .It leaves me wondering if the expert in view  should either1) Hang up his hator2) Pull a talking rabbit out of his hat who  can explain on his behalf why it is fine to let the media suggest this 'yellow box' is leading edge technology.We wouldn't want misleading statements to be conducive to fooling investors and clients would we?Been watching LEG with interest for a while but I do my research and I am less impulsive these days.CheersCT","Re: The West Article","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/the-west-article.2812406/page-5?post_id=18281481","622","2","15/07/16","16:41:03","0.9¢","None","Not Held"

Kudos to Mumford and Sons.  That is taking a stand that our gutless leaders won't.  The Swedish government has given away their country and it takes some foreign rock group to take a stand on you allowing your country to become the rape capital of Europe and to bankrupt it within a few decades with a welfare system that is out of control.'There are serious allegations here. Swedenindeed have far more reported cases of sexual assault than any other country. But it’s not because Swedes – of any colour – are very criminal. It’s because they’re very feminist. In 2005 Sweden’s Social Democratic government introduced a newwith the world’s most expansive definition of rape.Imagine for example if your boss rubbed against you in an unwanted way at work once a week for a year. In Canada this would potentially be a case of sexual assault. Under Germany’s more limited laws it would be zero cases. In Sweden it would be tallied as 52 separate cases of rape. If you engaged in a half-dozen sex acts with your spouse then later you felt you had not given consent in Sweden that would be classified as six cases of rape.The marked increase in rape cases during the 2000s is almost entirely a reflection of Sweden’s deep public interest in sexual equality and the rights of women not of attacks by newcomers.

Its organizers called it the Bonus Expeditionary Force to echo the name of World War I's American Expeditionary Forces while the media called it the Bonus Army. It was led by Walter W. Waters a former army sergeant.Many of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. The World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924 had awarded them bonuses in the form of certificates they could not redeem until 1945. Each service certificate issued to a qualified veteran soldier bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment plus compound interest. The principal demand of the Bonus Army was the immediate cash payment of their certificates.Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler one of the most popular military figures of the time visited their camp to back the effort and encourage them. On July 28 U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell ordered the veterans removed from all government property. Washington police met with resistance shots were fired and two veterans were wounded and later died.The Bonus Army marchers with their wives and children were driven out and their shelters and belongings burned.A second smaller Bonus March in 1933 at the start of the Roosevelt administration was defused in May with an offer of jobs for the Civilian Conservation Corps at Fort Hunt Virginia which most of the group accepted. Those who chose not to work for the CCC by the May 22 deadline were given transportation home.In 1936 Congress overrode President Franklin D. Roosevelt's veto and paid the veterans their bonus nine years early.","Re: Military Instructed Not to Intervene in Paris Attack","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/military-instructed-not-to-intervene-in-paris-attack.2811926/page-12?post_id=18280769","699","3","15/07/16","15:41:36","","",""

And let's assume the disclosed short interest is correct / close enough to correct.I agree the trading programs play around with the bid offer and the stacking of orders etc but do you think that is really having a big impact on the primary trend particularly given the short interest is quite low?Insto and retail buy and sell flows whether done via DMA or a real broker are having a much more significant impact on the price than quant funds and other computerised trading flows.  And these flows are like due to the previous high expectations that haven't been met etc etc (see all my other posts).Also a lot of the insto DMA orders are likely VWAP trades which should make little difference in terms of the manpulation being referred to. But this flow will definitely impact price but whether it is done via a computerised program or not is a separate issue to manipulation.My guess is that quant funds and non VWAP DMA orders are playing around with intraday volatility and adding a bit to the daily volatility but having minimal impact on the primary trend particularly given the short interest is so low .I am definitely not saying you're assuming this but lots of people think they are smart when a stock they're long goes up but when it goes down it must be manipulation etc (attribution bias).","Re: Broker data","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/broker-data.2811736/page-8?post_id=18279937","2116","","15/07/16","14:44:12","49.0¢","Buy","Not Held"

Shu YeungbyThe early year strength of China's economy has been maintained with annual growth in the second quarter of 6.7 per cent better than most had expected.The overall reading was helped by a big jump in retail sales and a modest rise in industrial production.After declining for much of the year retail sales grew at an impressive annual rate of 10.6 per cent in June up from growth of 10 per cent in May.Industrial production was slightly better than expected growing an annual rate of 6.2 per cent in June up from 6 per cent in the previous month.Both these readings appear to have benefited from looser money supply after M2 increased at a rapid annual rate of 11.8 per cent in June.Despite the better than expected result China's economy is still growing at its slowest rate in seven years.Fixed Asset Investment continued to slow growing by 9 per cent over the first half.While this measure of construction activity is still high by western standards it is well down on the 10.5 per cent growth reported over the first four months of the year.Within this figures private investment is particularly weak.Growth slowed to 2.8 per cent over the first half less than one third of the growth rate seen in 2015.Despite the better than expected reading ANZ economist Raymond Yeung said the second half of the year would be challenging. The economic outlook in the second half will be grim on slowing investment and softening global demand  he said in a note to clients. Attaining a growth rate of 6.5 per cent in 2016 remains a strenuous task. Mr Yeung said the property-led recovery seen in the first quarter had dissipated.To boost growth in the second half there are once again strong expectations the central government will embark on a new round of interest rate cuts and target fiscal spending.These expectations were heightened when Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday night there was a need to  expand demand moderately .","Re: Target price:: $2.75!","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/target-price-2-75.2795022/page-311?post_id=18279322","65603","3","15/07/16","13:58:19","$1.88","Buy","Held"

On the other hand the drilling south of the pit is indicated as shallow by the picture and was done sometime ago when standards might not have been so high. Vertical shallow holes to me indicate a geo that sits in the Toyota out of the sun and rain and supervises the collection of samples for first pass gold analysis. Often these blokes aren't obsessed with logging the chips and the pegmatite in the shallow weathered clays might be harder to spot as well.You never answered my question about the brines.

Play that and no more shots to play.Its worth a long and sustained rally with clear air.With the fog of pre-merge its another feast for day-traders.Jeez. Bugger that. It'd be like asking a girl to marry you while you're waiting in the dole queue.Your decision to wait this out won't be the cause of anything but neither is it being part of any solution either. SDV info is already out there to study. The main thing is the finance plan - and Plan A currently hinges on the merge.Time to put that GMM hat on again but properly - and around the right way.The real question is what would happen to GMM without a merge?The boss wants it and they've been wanting to do it since Day 1. It is Fotios returning to his old company and buying back into GXY with a huge chunk of money. He becomes a director of Galaxy with 10% more shares. What does GMM look like when management no longer own shares in the company?One way or another this will happen. And soon. Its most likely to happen in a rush when the remaining Top 21 slide in - something they're probably colluding on the timing of with a few little phone calls behind the scenes right now.Guys like yourself - in the name of being careful are just dragging this out for the rest of us for no reward. You will just get your GXY shares later than the rest of us.Your shares are worth less than GXY-merged options and GMM would soon be left behind. GXY can go on to JV with anybody they'd like on SDV.GMM is Option Number One - The Fair Deal. The best scenario for both companies.Option Number Two - GMMEXIT and hello to a bigger finance partner in SDV.If I was Ruthless Tony I'd ring Agreeable Mike the minute acceptance hit 80% and de-list GMM. Remove the offer and eventually replace with a lower one. No hurry though...Then the fence sitters could enjoy a bit of the sharp end for a few months while the rest of us get on with our lives at GXY.Only kidding. But yeah.... No Pain No Gain.","Re: GMM Merge: Everyone needs to vote...

IBG value - based on their medium grade JORC is currently according to my calculation sitting above .002% compared with OVR which is now above .001% igv based on the current zinc price.  That's what the market is valuing now - very very depressed. But if zinc decides to run in a positive global economic climate then the current valuations tend to find its way or are aiming to the crude target at 3% igv .  Take OVR in 2010/2011 - 8.95MT @ 7.5% zinc equivalent (158.5 million shares on issue) in ground value at 3% = 28c per share.  It comfortably hits 40c p/s and settles around 20-25c p/s.

KNL can no doubt produce the quality/quantity of their desire. The 200t “sample” is the strongest endorsement any listed graphite company has. Sojitz are quite literally recalibrating their machines to process KNL’s ore with the expectation they’ll get exactly what they’re after. Possibly better given the better than expected grades mined.All that aside and let’s pretend the sound business decision of locking in existing customers for next year’s profit’s wasn’t so sound after all (in all seriousness though that was a brilliant move). The graphite market even on the best case blue-sky scenario can only hold so many mines. KNL hand-picked the tenements long before many of the recent entrants claimed superior grades (as the above posts confirm it’s only through processing the ore which anyone KNL included but have no need for can do).The market cannot support even in the best case scenario half of the listed plays claiming they’ll be one of the poster-boys succeeding. Think Pilbirra anyone? It’s impossible to start a new mine in the area with many existing mines being mothballed and this is for a ubiquitous resource that everyone needs/can use.Customers are king. If you don’t have them it is only a matter of time before you’re proven to be no more than a vested-interest with no clear path to production/profitability. And let’s not forget why we’re in this it is to be profitable! And make money!Customers make this happen.","Re: Epanko schist's ~99% purity","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/epanko-schists-99-purity.2811701/page-24?post_id=18278938","4959","25","15/07/16","13:29:11","26.5¢","Buy","Held"

And Conoco has made it clear it would be making short-term decisions to improve its financial position including a focus on shale operations in Texas.  We certainly do not see the exit of [Conoco] from the offshore Senegal JV as a sign of the imminent demise of the JV.  It also believes Woodside is well placed to unlock significant value from the Senegal assets given a strong balance sheet proven experience on deep-water projects and its desire to fill a gap in its development pipeline.

Galaxy gets to throw open the phones turn on the lights and start taking names and numbers.How high can GXY's spodumene prices go if its left to Lithium Bay auction?All in all - a very good response from Tse to a tight situation that was beginning to fester - moved Client 2 more quickly into pre-payment.Tse probably threatened the total removal of off-take to move along discussions when they started saying  I want this I want that .Makes no sense that a client who has agreed to 60kt for next year would only want 15kt this year.Where do they normally get their supply from - Greenbushes?Client 2 probably said - we'll pay you when its ready and Tse said  nope - cash now or your entire shipment goes to auction .Chances are GXY will have a bigger consignment to go to auction by the end of the year - and a nice way of putting some more heat underneath the contract price.The spot market consignment gives GXY some real figures to put on the table for the second shipment pricing. No point in taking the client's word for what demand looks like.Who knows the answer to your question right now though?

It gets established over the next few years and then it is upgraded with OBJ tech to enhance the performance and is an easy sell as the current users will guarantee sales.Nothing in this world works quickly. It would be different if OBJ went it alone. They could get for instance body guard in its current for and distribute it. Good luck with that. Where as P&G or whoever takes it on will have a program to further test enhance and then look at when to introduce the product so to get the best fit. No point in canalizing your own product unless that is factored in.Another point before you get excited.When the license is signed in the next week or so don't expect a product launch asap. If it happens then bonus but and that's a strong but I cannot recall a company signing a license agreement to go out and launch a product the next day. Also no further orders have been announced need at least a month to stock up and distribute to locations. Add to that can you recall any product been launched at during the Olympics? be interesting if there was one.One more global rollouts also do not happen on day one.

If you recall  because I had received no answer myself when I asked you were going to ask and see if you had any joy.As a recap the original idea was the 2nd interim was going to be triggered at a point of 50% of the expected MACE and if all went well there would be a discussion with the FDA about fast-tracking to approval - very exciting!!However the recent and more subdued announcement left me thinking that the 2nd interim was now going to be an administrative look to see whether to continue the trial or wrap it up as a phase 2b (which to me now it appears it should be) and focus on other stuff; Japan catheters RA. There was no mention of reaching the 50% threshold whereby the possible  overwhelming efficacy  tests could be undertaken. Just to be clear i am not expecting Mesoblast to talk about trial results but clearly they do know how many MACE have occurred across all patients otherwise they would never have had the original plans for the 2nd interim.This is a legitimate question on my part - I really do not know what they are planing next year in Q1 2017. I suppose if you respond you might want to include some questions about my motives etc which is fine with me but I would also like to know if you got an answer from Julie Meldrum in relation to the 2nd interim.","Re: If MSB is to return to $10...","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/if-msb-is-to-return-to-10.2811501/page-72?post_id=18279076","8164","","15/07/16","13:39:29","$1.12","None","Not Held"

Given the Ni market at the time I'd say a very feasible reason especially for a company like CAD with very limited capital resources. I was very surprised at the time of them even attempting it however there may have been other factors at work there. I don't know. Would guess the dewatering of the BS pit was not the reason for pulling out although it can be a costly business doing it.There was an announcement during 2015 that LJ was getting dewatered as I can recall them quoting that the amount was equivalent to 1.5 Olympic sized pools each day. Seem to recall the cost being $250k per quarter but don't quote me on that figure. I also think the amount getting pumped out was not the full amount but enough to keep it manageable.As for SS it certainly looks like that has been kept in working order to enable them to do more calculative work on it.Cheers.","Re: In the office today","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/in-the-office-today.2809918/page-172?post_id=18279113","25899","","15/07/16","13:42:20","6.2¢","None","Not Held"

Witnesses said the driver sped up one street and down another sometimes the wrong way picking off people in crosswalks and on sidewalks. At least one victim was in critical condition Tuesday night; several others were treated and released. It was like (the movie) 'Death Race 2000'   firefighter Danny Bright said at California and Fillmore streets where four victims were hit.  Guys were walking down the sidewalk and the guy just came up and ran them over. The guy went crazy. Less than an hour earlier a black Honda Pilot had run down a 54-year-old man walking in the bike lane on Fremont Boulevard in Fremont killing him. Police believe that the man whose name had not been released Tuesday evening was the San Francisco hit-and-run driver's first victim.Police identified the sport utility vehicle driver as Omeed Aziz Popal 29 who had just gotten married in his native Afghanistan was living with his parents in Fremont and had nothing on his criminal record except a handful of minor traffic violations. He was expected to be booked on 14 counts of attempted murder police said.Some family members said Popal had mental problems and lived in fear of the devil; others said his recent arranged marriage may have made him stressed.A source close to the investigation in San Francisco however said Popal showed no signs of mental illness or remorse in his initial interviews with authorities. Popal reportedly told police that he had run down pedestrians  because he just wanted to. Witnesses in San Francisco described the same unreal terrifying scene again and again: A black SUV whose driver would chase walkers and bicyclists up the street and across lawns and slammed on the accelerator to pick off his victims...","Re: Military Instructed Not to Intervene in Paris Attack","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/military-instructed-not-to-intervene-in-paris-attack.2811926/page-8?post_id=18279338","700","1","15/07/16","13:59:46","","",""

My initial take is that Woodside have done way the better side of this bargain although COP had handled the sale badly and telegraphed the sale all round the market. Historically they are not good traders in these situations but at least with a keen owner  it means that development will probably kick on as WPL have said that they will fast track to near term production and take over the operatorship. Buying a class asset at $2.20 is outstanding and COP have given away an asset in order to pay the dividend such things happen in these markets and WPL will in due course be applauded for making a superb counter cyclical move. With WPL and Far using the same reserves data one can be sure that Far consider their stake in the licences to be way higher than their current share price.","Malcy on FAR/CNE","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/malcy-on-far-cne.2813215/?post_id=18279387","2187","18","15/07/16","14:03:26","7.8¢","Buy","Held"

Just thought I might add some thoughts to this conversation.On the pharmacy side of the business it is probably the emergence of discount chains and other corporate models has meant groups have been able to pressure Corum on their fee structure. For example when there were more independents they individually paid full price. Many independents have in recent years joined alliances to compete with the larger discounters. Groups like Chemist Warehouse have been able to negotiate multi-site licences at a much reduced fee (i.e. screwed Corum). So every independent that joins a group or is bought by a group out has cost Corum income. The landscape has changed significantly.Corum may have lost a few clients also but I think this is not the major effect on income it is what I have stated above. Their market share is still around 40% of the 5000 odd pharmacies in Australia.  Most of the providers including the major competitor FRED also have failed to invest in system technology upgrades in recent times so all would have attracted some client dissatisfaction. A lot of the issues that arise at the pharmacy level are not Corum's fault alone. Many pharmacies have failed to invest in upgrading computer systems & software staff training and business management and accounting conectivity. As the software has added more bells and whistles over the years to accommodate quality assurance systems electronic prescriptions drug interaction databases quality use of medicines electronic ordering & invoicing electronic PBS claiming Dose administration aids etc etc (many of the new services have been funded by government at the expense of PBS fees and margins for pharmacy).Corum's client base is still its best asset but it is probably static at best so it has to introduce new innovative products to grow income streams from current clients and this seems to be the stumbling block at present. It is very difficult to see how the dispensary side of technology can be improved further in the foreseeable future so it is probably developments in the business management and retailing areas that will present the most promise.If Corum wants Corum to grow its client base in pharmacy the best means is acquiring another software provider (simple as that). If Corum is struggling so are they for the same market forces so perhaps an opportunity will arise soon. There are still good margins to be made.In the payment services area they need to get cracking and find new niche clients. I don't think it is unrealistic to assume that if they had been on their game years ago they could have entered the mass market that PayPal BPay etc now dominate (of course they would have been bought out). But they perhaps have missed many opportunities along the way. The Pharmacy Guild ran a very profitable manual monthly accounts payments service for years (The Guild Clearing House). We manually filled out a suppliers list form and sent it with a cheque to the Guild. Each month the Guild held mega millions which was invested in short term money markets before supplies were actually paid. Perhaps a lost opportunity for Corum as Lots had already captured the majority of supplier invoices electronically so back office reconciling and linking to bill payments through Corum would have been a lot simpler than the manual system. It was a captive audience - perhaps there is still an opportunity as it of course links both Corum's pharmacy and payments services.The tech savvy GenX & GenY and some of us enlightened oldies are all now using electronic payment services to pay fees pay accounts make online purchases. Surely this is still potentially a growth area for Corum. As recently as this year a large school stopped taking individual term payments from parents and now they have to pay through a USA based provider. Where was Corum?I am sure the Corum  think tank  is hard at work. Not so the $12m in the cash bucket. Maybe they need to look outside the square.Has the Nadir been reached though? That is want investors would like to know.","Re: Ann: Trading Update-COO.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-trading-update-coo-ax.2811418/page-8?post_id=18279444","667","2","15/07/16","14:07:44","8.5¢","Buy","Held"

Brexit can't be used as the excuse for the reduction as the price was what it was before Brexit occurred but the decision was made to reduce it to the max 20% possible reduction level (why?)CR was quickly smashed by sophs - perfect. The quick uptake shows it did not need to be reduced to 3.6c.Quick money in the door move onwards and upwards...But then the SPP was initiated...(why now? why not wait until the SP was pushed up again by the CR and new buyers?)PIO now been in virtual standstill for 2 weeks going on 3 weeks due to the SPP & subsequent extension.But then the SPP was extended...(why??)The Ann said PIO were  pleased to advise  the extension... to give holders more time to consider their position ...There was a closing date on the intial offer. It said first come first served....there should not have been any need for an extension if SH were showing an  extremely positive  response to the SPP.If this were the case it should have been sold out ASAP. It would have taken 166 SH at $15000 each to fulfill the requirement.If more SH paid less per head it still shouldn't have taken more than say 500 - 1000 SH to complete the SP within that 2 week period.Aust Post - yes this new system is a debacle but there is no excuse for SH in NZ & QLD to get their forms before SH in Perth and for PIO to have to re-issue forms. There must have been a serious administrative error for that to happen (I used to live in WA now in QLD and I know the difference in the time it takes for mail to arrive to/from and within each location).In today's e-society how come an e-form could not be emailed to each SH ref on it? They want to be paid by Bpay - so why not make it easy on SH and send the paperwork electronically as well as collect the funds electronically.To prevent the negative assumptions that have came out from all this the SPP should either have been closed or the Extension Ann should have manned up and outlined the real reason for the delay (noting the possibility that some SH may not have yet received their paperwork) and not blur over the lines.Again if interest was so great there was no reason the SPP couldn't have been taken up in the 2 week period even with slow mail.In the meantime squabbles continue to occur and escalate on HC. I have been reading in the background for months now and is really hard to read.  It has been turning tit-for-tat and is really quite embarrassing to see grown men squabble.I have expanded my reading to other stock sites and have seen how grown men can discuss stocks without the keyboard warrior insults and innuendo that the PIO thread has spiraled into.Bas & James - I appreciate your posts. They may not be what people want to hear however as an investor I completely appreciate hearing different opinions and ways of seeing things. I agree with many of your points raised and I disagree with others.Same with the PIObulls - it has been great to see the enthusiasm for the stock and future movement and appreciate the research and information being posted encouraging myself to carry out my own research and taking ideas further to see where they are headed but please turn down the defensiveness when alternate ideas are raised.Investing is objective not subjective. Stop the squabbling we are all in this to make money (LT or DT) and we can all learn a little from one another and we can all be happy little pigs in the near future. Common goal.Just a shame I didn't put my money in PSC during this 3 week SPP hiatus/hiccup  - their curve is exactly where I thought PIO was headed and still could do with Mavis Raleigh and ACRA.Hopefully we will hear something on ACRA soon - about time.Good luck to all and please play nice.","Re: Smart move that TH - Brexit","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/smart-move-that-th-brexit.2798270/page-77?post_id=18279650","16560","13","15/07/16","14:24:14","3.4¢","Buy","Held"

That equates to around 70MWh.“I believe millions of Australians will look at converting their homes to run off solar power given how easy it is to add batteries” Thorne said.","Re: We're going to need a BIGGER boat!","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/were-going-to-need-a-bigger-boat.2800599/page-7?post_id=18279687","1250","5","15/07/16","14:26:53","3.4¢","Buy","Held"

I backed AHF because I liked (and still do although it has its own issues at the moment) the business model and struggled to see what AYB and CFF were trying to do and to me they just didn't quite have their head around the dairy space they wanted to pursue. AYB at least had a similar view to that of AHF but it has gone off the rails badly.I am not sure this is one for the regulators but certainly the current incumbents needs to seriously lift their game in all areas before this company will garner any market trust and become investment appealing.I will let the cat out of the bag but can't comment too deeply but there was an opportunity for them to secure about 100m+ litres of milk from a range of willing farms within the same general region of State of Victoria and get funding to put in place its own processing facilities and this would have come with a good operational management and good governance team.

By taking over the existing debt gridComm will be expected to pay less equity in the form of shares to ODN holders.I would think 20:1 more likely for the above reasons making ODN's share only around 5%.

Pre brexit it was trading well over 3.5 and certainly nothing negative has happened to NOR since that time. In fact there has been much promising news since NOR was well north of 3.8 cents.But this is the markets. NOR is worth what its worth.I think NOR's hope of getting the SP over 0.35 now only depends on confirmed revenue next week which may just be a little out of reach for them time wise.Still it's not all that grim. As Holla said on a previous thread. they still have 3.5 locked in from the sophs and we have now have it confirmed from NOR that Corona will go live this quarter.Should they need to they will have little trouble doing going for the 1 million again in the next quarter ideally after they have ann their first OTT contract and Corona clients are ann and building. If they don't need too we may might just yet have saved us some equity dilution although it does make it a higher stakes game for the OTT's.This will be game of patience for the true believers.","Re: First Corona Cloud and Corona GTS","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/first-corona-cloud-and-corona-gts.2812193/page-16?post_id=18280089","2516","4","15/07/16","14:55:40","3.0¢","Buy","Held"

Agree with pretty much everything you said. This is the second second super-major to have left money on the table re FAR acreage but if you've ever dealt with them you'd appreciate the unique mindset. They're like investment banks. Knee-jerk thinking. One minute they're hiring like mad and doling out bonuses like a Powerball and the next they're axing everyone in sight selling the potplants and cancelling the after-hours aircon.I have heard rumours of the numbers they got for the in-line sale of the deepwater assets and they were truly awful. Abysmal. So a half-decent lowball offer for senegal probably looks great in comparison.CNE won't stump up. And have hobbled themselves somewhat by their stick-in-the-mud approach to date. But I have a feeling (in my waters) that there may be some parties already warmed-over and semi-ready. I don't think we are quite as un-prepared as yesterday suggested....Oddly enough I am miffed that it was WPL which had the smarts to try this. Have always found them so flat-footed and here they have been anything but.I'm incredibly excited by this. It's a long shot but with a bit of luck we could end up with a seat at the big table just before what I see as a strong cyclical recovery....Conoco remind of those guys that do the hard slog of the marathon and quit a few ks from home.Can't remember who the poster was with this Shakespearean line as their sign off but I think it's appropriate -  there comes a time in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune . I think we're at that point now.

Potential investors will want to get in as cheaply as possible so games are going to be played. The China announcement on Monday along with the investor roadshow presentation suggests to me the company is looking to raise some cash before expanding into China. The company only has USD $6m cash and if they want to set up a manufacturing facility and do business in China this is going to cost money and it is a wise move to strengthen their balance sheet.I am firmly of the belief that if a capital raising was to occur it could be to clients of EAS as they are EMC's North American advisor. We have seen in other stocks what can happen when the right people are involved in a placement. As an example LNG raised cash to clients of EAS at the following prices:-  31c per share in Dec 2013- 55c in May 2014- $2.60 in July 2014- $4.35 in May 2015If indeed a placement was to occur and I hope it does I would expect the share price to be supported strongly. Once the breaks are off I'd be expecting the mother of all share price runs. Current prices will be a distant memory IMO.I could be completely off the mark but this is how I see the current situation.Cheers","Re: Ann: China Strategy-EMC.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-china-strategy-emc-ax.2809656/page-70?post_id=18280128","10824","25","15/07/16","14:58:05","73.5¢","Buy","Held"

However the following statement confuses me: It's not because of the announcement... the announcement doesn't give us too much detail. Share price before announcement was 7.8c share price now is 7c. This drop is absolutely to do with the announcement and the market's interpretation thereof. As it was when the SP dropped from 26.5c to 12.5c immediately after the 1st drill results announcement. I accept that you are in it for the long term but it really shouldn't baffle you that people are selling - they don't like what they see and are losing money. I also accept that this is a speculative stock but this is probably another reason why many are getting out - the degree of speculation is just too much for them or they feel their cash could be better invested in another stock at this time - no problems with that. I personally think the Lynas results are good as far as grade is concerned but the key piece if information on quantity is still missing. Without this I cannot make an informed decision and have to go with my gut feel which prompted me to take a punt on DKO in the first place. So I hold at least until the resource statement is released. Do I want the SP to take off? Sure. Will it? I have no ide. Thanks for your valued contributions.

Have you suggested any of this to FAR?  One hopes that RN BC GR and Cath are all over this ..... now that it has happened.I have had an email from Cath that indicated that they were unaware that COP had progressed this far in negotiating a sale (they were expecting COP would sell at some stage as it had been clearly stated they were exiting deep water).  So as you suggest you would expect that FAR has been working on  scenarios  and funding options but that they may not yet be ready to act.There's plenty of news expected  in coming weeks  (or months!) like FAR's statement on commerciality most likely a resource upgrade (RISC is overdue for an update IMHO) and presumably updated prospective resource estimates for the JV blocks from seismic results.  There could also be some news on the Djiffere seismic before too long (weeks/months?) as they have to decide whether to take up their option by October.  But even if this news is good and it adds to the share price raising capital for an increase in JV equity via a CR would be just too dilutive at this stage so we still need other financing options to have any chance of acquiring more equity in the leases.  I like your suggestion of a deal with WPL to finance a purchase of more equity in exchange for operatorship.  From a strategic perspective FAR only needs to acquire 2-3% more equity to give the WPL/FAR block a majority interest (to counteract any back-in by Petrosen that would reduce FAR to 13.8%).  Not sure how strong FAR's negotiating position is though.  Maybe something like what WPL did with HDR may be a possibility ... they took a 19.9% position in HDR I think at a premium to protect them from being taken over.  Also HDR bought equity off a JV partner who wanted out and onsold it for a large profit ... lessons there for FAR!And it is good news that WPL will be more  motivated  than COP to go to development and possibly earlier production.  In a way his purchase by WPL is an effective DoC!  If we get DoC earlier that may open up funding options but I can't see that happening in the timeframes you suggest FAR needs to act.Interesting times indeed!H","Re: The Deal ...and its just started...","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/the-deal-and-its-just-started.2813186/page-9?post_id=18280303","12765","26","15/07/16","15:09:58","7.7¢","Buy","Held"

It'll also have a brief fling with the RISK report.This as Phillip321 stated above is the most exciting opportunity for FAR to really step up into the Big Game.  So if they don't/can't make a go of it there's likely to be some disappointed holders.The more I think about it the more I believe that FAR MUST take this opportunity.  Otherwise they will be cementing our position as an inconsequential minor JV partner; a price taker and not a price maker.  I know that description may offend some fanatics here but that's really what FAR is in the eyes of Big Oil.So Yes; I see some potentially pretty good upside with the Risk report and 'the Deal'*.  But if management cant do something with the pre-emptive I for one will be very disappointed.Cheers* of course I'd bloody well say this!

If that is your wish please just wait until it's announced to market instead of questioning my info.I doubt this will fall to the CR price. Not with the level of interest from big broking houses. They have also done presentations to some of these bigger houses in the last week in anticipation of the CR.My concern was the fact that the rise in recent weeks has been manipulated this way to get a higher CR. My broker basically stated - look at some of its peers whose prices have also risen markedly in recent weeks on the back of media reports citing  Silver as the new Gold  etc.","Re: Ann: Trading Halt-IVR.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-trading-halt-ivr-ax.2812924/page-22?post_id=18280625","3703","2","15/07/16","15:31:10","6.4¢","Buy","Not Held"

They claim to do this as they receive the email so should be no delay in Xped receiving it.2) Xped now have to confirm once they receive the form that they have received the funds (remember you are sending the money to Xped not Automic) be it by chq or eft.3) Once they know you've paid up they then have to get automic to process the conversion itself this information is then passed to your broker.As you can see there's a whole raft of potential reasons for delays so sit tight but it would be nice to see a confirmation from Xped that funds have been received so there's no worrying.","Re: PSA/Reminder - the XPEOB options expire July 21st and become worthless","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/psa-reminder-the-xpeob-options-expire-july-21st-and-become-worthless.2812986/page-35?post_id=18280631","4900","2","15/07/16","15:31:27","7.2¢","Buy","Held"

The guardsmen fired 61 rounds over a period of 13 seconds killing four students and wounding nine others one of whom suffered permanent paralysis.Some of the students who were shot had been protesting the Cambodian Campaign which President Richard Nixon announced during a television address on April 30. Other students who were shot had been walking nearby or observing the protest from a distance.There was a significant national response to the shootings: hundreds of universities colleges and high schools closed throughout the United States due to a student strike of four million students and the event further affected public opinion—at an already socially contentious time—over the role of the United States in the Vietnam War.U.S.'MY GOD!

Why reinvent the wheel?  If one reads history you will see that through the ages civilizations have been threatened by this same creature.  Eg the Knights Templar in the middle ages were set up by the Catholic church and various states throughout europe as a direct response to the threat of not only pilgrims travelling to the holy lands but as a direct response to the slaughter of hundreds & hundreds of thousands of innocent christians in the holy lands. You can read accounts of people walking into towns and the dead piled so high that people couldn't walk the streets. 70 to 80 thousand slaughtered in Acre alone. The response to this wholesale barbarity was the crusades which over subsequent crusades managed to wrest back control of the holy lands.The nature of the threat hasn't changed it is only our response now to this threat that has changed. Good people and families will I fear reach their breaking point very soon and if elected gov't isn't capable of protecting them they will take matters into their own hands.  The French have proved this many a time. Fear the French they have had five republics they are not adverse to taking royalty to the guillotine and standing up for their rights as a people.History also tells us that the Muslims invaded europe and managed to send back over 2 million slaves from southern europe to the middle east to work in their homes and farms. This is all documented. Their intent is clear.I am a moderate but the increasing escalation in violence and terrorism on innocents is now starting to change my point of view on a few things and if history is our guide we have a lot to fear but we aslo have a solution.","Re: French outrage..truck used to kill","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/french-outrage-truck-used-to-kill.2812851/page-243?post_id=18280704","11423","13","15/07/16","15:36:34","","",""

I had a look at KDR's release and it's interesting but I know where I would want my money.","Re: Ann: High Grade Lithium Mineralisation Intersected at Bougouni-BGS.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-high-grade-lithium-mineralisation-intersected-at-bougouni-bgs-ax.2810479/page-394?post_id=18280895","75201","14","15/07/16","15:50:51","33.5¢","Buy","Held"

Did they get a marketing % or flat fee reducing the royalty or are all costs deducted (hopefully with a cap)When it comes to price reaction I think if history is a guide pre the original license when we all got excited it went from 3ish to 9c then some months later it jumped on product launch. (also we had the coty and GSK potential coming).Then we found out it was a trial and price retreated.2 years later we are about to be at the same point again but this time with 2 licences (both a wand) at least. So I expect a jump on signing with a product launch some months later to give it another boost.I am not expecting to see these prices again unless the product fails in the market placetime will tell","Re: Eye wand","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/eye-wand.2812950/page-7?post_id=18280897","1685","6","15/07/16","15:50:55","7.9¢","Buy","Held"

From the article you showed is this line... Shares in the electronics firm's affiliate Samsung SDI jumped more than 8 percent in early trading in Seoul on hopes that it might be in line to supply electric vehicle batteries to BYD. So within a few months Samsung have gone from a company with a fuel cell department that they have sold recently (shown in an article I linked to yesterday I think) to a company making and wanting to supply Lithium batteries.They had spent hundreds of millions of dollars on fuel cell technology but ditched it as they opened their eyes to see what is really happening in the world. Smart company Samsung. At some point we will see Toyota do the same IMO which will just about be the final nail in the coffin of Hydrogen powered fuel cells as a choice for Vehicles.Somewhere around that point is when many  experts  around the worlld will finally wake up to the fact that Li-on powered batteries are the immediate future for the next 10-20 years at least and constant improvements in the lithium battery technology is likely to make it much longer.Even though Richard Branson thinks the world could be all EVs by 2025 I'd think it will be more likely 95% by 2040 but if you work out the amount of lithium needed for close to one Billion cars then several hundred million trucks busses and tractors etc it is a mind blowingly high number. Then add grid and personal home storage and you will wonder where the lithium can come from. More will need to be discovered!!","Re: Lithium Bubble ??","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/lithium-bubble.2811645/page-122?post_id=18280942","32286","18","15/07/16","15:53:57","62.5¢","Buy","Held"

There are a number of stocks like this on the ASX.I agree that they may try to tick the stock down or stack the offer to try to cover lower but I don't think that has a big impact on the primary trend.I posted a while ago the amount of volume that had gone through since the top and the amount of shorts since then. I can't remember the exact number but it was very small.Anyway it is a positive sign some shorts are covering.  A good quarterly and lots of retailers and momentum Traders will jump on board.BTW - I'm sure you know this but ML is the PB for underlying funds. It is not trading for ML itself.

Customers fall into the firm/reliable/genuine buyers and also the opposite encompassment. Market a product however you like but without genuine buyers you can't turn perceived value into wealth. You can market anything to infer value you can support this with information to indicate value but the only true measure of value is at the end of the day when people are buying what your selling.

If its the former then we have a third party who is going to be in a world of pain at some stage but if its the latter then we should expect a ceasing to be substantial notice before too long. And if its the latter I wonder if ASIC/ATO have anything to say on the matter.

Where have you got this information from Ozblue? General Lithium clearly state on their website they have current capacity of 6500 tonne per year of lithium carbonate products and using the 8 to 1 rule of thumb to convert 6% spodumene to carbonate that equals 52 000 tonne of spodumene which they obviously already have a off take agreement for that feed stock since they are producing.General lithium now have a binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Pilbara to establish a downstream processing joint venture to produce a minimum of 20000 tonnes per annum of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide of which they will fund 50%.Once again using the 8 to 1 rule of thumb that plant would require 160 000 tonne of spodumene so how do you come to 280 000 tonne? Also obviously they need this plant built to process the 140 000 tonne of spodumene so what happens to that offtake agreement if the joint venture for downstream processing doesnt eventuate?Speaking of which what is the cost of a 20 000 tonne carbonate plant? Tianqi brought Galaxy's 17 000 tonne plant for US$230 million could this be used as a bench mark for the costs of a 20 000 tonne plant meaning Pilbara will have to fork out another US$115 million for half to even see this spodumene off take agreement finalised? What will the internal rate of return be for such a plant based on current prices? Do they have a off take agreement for the lithium carbonate? Question that need to be answered for potential investor I imagine.Basically because of the possible down stream processing jv it appears the off take agreement really is only 70 000 tonne to General lithium and 70 000 to Pilbara themselves. So for a   70 000 off take agreement they get to own 3% of the company by paying A$17.75 million valuing 100% of the company based on that deal at A$591 million. Cant see any further potential offtakers wanting a worse deal.","Re: Upcoming DFS & BOAs","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/upcoming-dfs-boas.2812583/page-30?post_id=18281237","9343","1","15/07/16","16:17:38","62.0¢","None","Not Held"

The most recent example was in 1989 when Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke made airforce personnel and aircraft available for use by commercial airlines after their own fleets were grounded by the mass resignations of their pilots. The pilots were pursuing a wage increase outside the industrial relations system.After a protracted dispute the airlines triumphed and the pilots' union was grounded. The Government's intervention was crucial to the outcome. Successes like this fuel calls from some sectors of the community for the Government to use its military muscle to buy into other difficult industrial disputes-particularly those judged to be endangering national welfare.On 15 August 1997 the Australian Financial Review reported that the National Farmers Federation had urged the Howard Coalition Government to consider as an option bringing in the troops to speed up reform on the waterfront and keep the docks operating during a strike. The Government was subsequently reported to have drawn up detailed plans for handling any major waterfront confrontation. However the Prime Minister Mr Howard categorically ruled out sending in the troops.

Such agreement(s) could be constructed unilaterally or multilaterally - with any number of our current or potential partners. The Board’s preference at this juncture is for a single unilateral agreement. The Company can now announce that we are formally in negotiations to execute this type of agreement with such a counterparty. These negotiations are evolving and ongoing and given the complexity and importance of the agreement the final execution will likely take a few months to finalize. The Company looks forward to providing key updates to shareholders in this regard as and when necessary.I think many were/are hoping for some commercial deals this year.

Also whilst all you happy clappers are convinced the QR will be fantastic I however hold my breath as im still unconvinced at this stage.

Most of the largest companies in the world today took a long time to become successful and profitable.   And yes they do often have to keep raising money which is one of the reasons these companies are called highly speculative stocks.  You can be diluted significantly by the time the company is successful.  For the early investors in DUO those who held one will possibly never see their initial investment returned.   That is why when I invest in speculatives I try to trade into a free-carried position as quickly as possible.  It is how I significantly reduce my risk.  Didn't work for me with DUO/ZYB but if you're going to trade/invest at this end of town you've got to take the hits.

At that time a merino weather was worth $7-12 as soon as the first boat order came out at $23 the processors could pay the extra & stepped up  they could afford it all the time.Don't think for one minute they are generous souls they are far from that.When I first started to breed wagyu cattle in the late 90's the feedlots were offering $2.50/kilo for F1 feeders as soon as the first boats started taking them to feedlots in Japan they upped their price.When the Gillard Govt. stopped the trade in it's tracks the effect was immediate . The boats stopped leaving the north but in the south the cattle market dropped 30% overnight even though those surplus cattle were not coming south.The result of that ban was exacerbated by a dry period in the south & no wet season in the north so the cattle that were destined to export stayed in the dry paddock along with the next drop of calves & they died like flies their value was less than the freight south & no one here wanted them as we were in the crap too.Remember that in the past decade or so processor competition has tightened with the export market dominated by JBS (Brazilian) Nippon (Japan) & Cargill (USA) so any stopping of the live trade would hand them the whip hand the result being bigger margins with the profits being sent offshore & all the time they are asking for more 457 visa workers. We lost the initiative when we sold the processing sector to foreign interests the only chance we have to keep profits local is to export live . The other thing no mentioned much is the trade for Dairy heifers to China & Russia with the problems in milk prices this has been for many the only thing that has saved them.History has shown us that the livexport trade is the only tool we have for keeping those buggers honest.","Re: Live Cattle Export - is it worth it employment wise","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/live-cattle-export-is-it-worth-it-employment-wise.2697805/page-122?post_id=18281602","6013","4","15/07/16","16:53:02","","",""

I feel at times the sentiment around a stock can affect how a particular announcement is received. Right now sentiment is tragic at no real fault of management or the work being done. They're working hard and meeting timelines. Whilst there is no definite indication regarding the scale of the resource that takes time to achieve and if any of you have been following it's very difficult for companies to release  forward looking statements  due to new ASIC/ASX rules. It's harder for companies to do business but easier for the share price to get played go figure.So back to explaining... sentiment is bad announcement is ok/good/decent and SP falls. Did the announcement really do it? No... the annoucement if anything continues to  indicate  good grades they will find a commercial resource. I don't know the professions of most posters here or their intentions so I'm not going to believe their work to say the results show thin/low-grade intersects. If anything it looks better than Mt Cattlin based on the intersect images. So I'll leave it for the company to advise in the resource statementSmart money doesn't usually sell at a loss. Smart money put money in at 20 cents and sold at 28.5 cents. Now buying in a big way and getting quite a healthy position awaiting the next leg up.What DKO have is worth a lot more than their market cap is right now and I will not be selling out cheaply like some have done. Sure there might be better ways to utilise your capital but considering the low SP and people in loss positions selling at a loss is not effective use of capital unless you get double the gains on another stock. All are free to do as they wish.I kept my word and bought more. Averaged down nicely.

Previously the Matlabas loop could only accommodate 50-wagon trains.The State-owned freightgroup said thehad increased the line’s yearly capacity from 400 000 t/y to two-million tons by enablingFreight(TFR) to increase its weeklyfrom two to five trains.The announcement follows recent criticism by which described as “disappointing” thesupply in the Waterberg region since the beginning of the year.In a pre-close update on operational performance from January to June 30 The JSE-listed company reported receiving only 3.5 trains a week from TFR instead of the required five and said the situation was likely to persist until the culmination in July of theline shutdown.The Matlabas loop was described byas the first phase in a five-phase expansion of theline between the Waterberg and the Richards BayTerminal in KwaZulu-.of the second phase is under way to increase the line’s yearly capacity to six-million tons. This stage involves theof a 2.8 km loop at Thabazimbi theof a new five-kilometre line to connect the loops at Bleskop and Norite as well as theof a new seven-kilometre line to connect the loops at Dam and Onderstepoort and create another double line section.“The long loops and short double line sections will enable long trains to pass without disrupting.  Upon completion of the second stage TFR will increase the currentfrom one 200-wagon train a day to three big trains a day” the company said in a statement.Theformed part of a larger R21.8-billion programme to increase thecorridor’s capacity to 81-million tons.railed 72.1-million tons down the corridor in 2015/16 and expectsvolumes to recover to 75-million tons this year which is still below the 76.3-million railed in 2015. The forecast is also well below projections in its 2012 Market Demand Strategy which assumed thatvolumes would have climbed to 84-million tons in 2016/17.As a result of the fall in commodity priceshad moderated the pace of its expenditure on both theandlines but insists that it will continue to expandcapacity and open upcapacity forminers in the Waterberg.","Re: coal prices rising","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/coal-prices-rising.2813106/page-2?post_id=18281689","130","5","15/07/16","17:02:30","8.0¢","None","Not Held"

According to insight obtained by local publication One Step Off the Grid the homes will range in price between $1.13 million to $1.6 million US dollars and feature high-tech amenities including access to a tech concierge home delivery menus accessible through a YarraBend app and electric vehicle charging powered by renewable energy.Homes within the community will come equipped with roof-mounted solar panels that will feed energy into a Tesla Powerwall home battery storage system. The abundance of sunshine in Australia has made it one of the first countries in the world to receive shipments of Tesla’s rechargeable lithium-ion home battery system. Combined with the fact that Australians on average see a much higher cost of energy than the rest of the world and with nearly two-thirds of Australians wanting to be self-sufficient in meeting their energy needs the trend towards adoption of Tesla’s Powerwall has steadily increased over the past six months since its introduction into the country.Nick Marinakis who heads up sales and marketing for Glenvil says YarraBend will achieve a 6-star ecologically sustainable development (ESD) rating making it the first infill development site in Melbourne to achieve such a high rating. Danni Addison the Victorian chief executive of the Urban Development Institute of Australia which developed the ESD rating system says the project is one of the most environmentally sustainable developments in Australia with a water reduction of 43 per cent landfill reduced by 80 per cent and the potential to reduce energy use by 34 per cent.Addison tells the Heidelberg Leader via One Step Off the Grid “The Powerwalls combined with solar panels (also standard) will mean that future residents will be able to benefit in a variety of ways including dramatically smaller power bills and knowing that the majority of their energy usage is coming from a clean and renewable source” .“The electric car charging points will be another available option” she said. “Combined with the Powerwall and solar panels it is likely that ‘refueling’ future residents’ electric cars will be free.”YarraBend aims to house nearly 5000 new residents when the project is complete making it double the suburb’s population of 4600 people according to data from a 2011 Census. Official contract signing on the project is expected to begin in August with residents expected to begin moving in towards late 2017.Did this project ever get off the ground ??Hot Trading Hot Capital","Tesla Town","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/tesla-town.2813366/?post_id=18281712","46","1","15/07/16","17:04:50","","",""

The Company utilizes Tamrock Solo 1020 top head hammer long-hole rigs to provide underground production drilling services which include grade control blast hole ground support and rise/slot drilling. The Company also has operations in Canada and the United States. The Swick Mobile Diamond Drill provides an integrated mobile drilling solution. It also offers underground production drilling services to the mining industry.These rigs/workshops are money earners and not a pile of rusting bulldozers. The company is profitable. Not by much but it makes money before depreciation and amortization. The rigs are 'best in class'. They require less man hours/metre drilled than their opposition. HUGE competitive advantage. Mines are profitable esp. gold sector. Base metals are however barely breaking even. More exploration drilling could eventuate esp. for gold.Best indicator is to see improvements/enhancements in their technology - ability to drill more metres at less cost than competition. One of the great things about SWK (besides it trading at a massive discount to NTA) is it very well placed to pick up a lot of contracts when companies start spending on exploration/capital projects. Company pretty healthy and a lot of competitors are really struggling and that puts it in a commanding position.

Gas stations today live and die on volume turnover geared to the roughly five minutes it takes to fill the tank. They make most of their profit on coffee cigarettes and snacks that can be dispensed quickly. The electric car revolution may change all that and once again Tesla Motors is at the forefront of the change.Sheetz operates a large chain of gas stations. It has hundreds of retail outlets located in six states mostly in the mid-Atlantic region. It does nearly $7 billion in business every year. Eight of its stores already have charging stations where EV drivers can recharge their batteries. Sheetz is currently talking to Tesla about adding its charging infrastructure to the Sheetz locations.“We’ve had discussions with them about putting their chargers in our stores” confirmed Michael Lorenz Sheetz’s executive vice president of petroleum supply in an interview. “We haven’t done anything yet but we’re continuing those discussions.” He declined to say how many Sheetz locations might be involved.Tesla declined to comment on the negotiations with Sheetz but acknowledged in a statement that it is actively courting gas stations hotels and restaurants in its bid to install high-speed electric chargers across the country.Sheetz may be ahead of the curve at this time but the coming electric car revolution is getting bigger in the rear view mirror. Already marketing experts are recommending that gas stations start thinking about adding chargers to their facilities. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that within six years electric cars will be as affordable as traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. By 2040 roughly 1 in 3 new vehicle sales could be an EV according to Bloomberg.Gas stations routinely dig up and replace their fuel tanks. It makes economic sense to bury the conduits that will be needed for the chargers of the future while that work is being done even if the actual chargers are not installed until later.As average fuel economy rises and advances in clean transportation technology occur traditional gas stations will soon face a difficult choice: adapt or die. Federal estimates suggest that by 2035 U.S. drivers could be consuming 20% less gasoline than they do today says John Eichberger executive director of the Fuels Institute founded by the National Association of Convenience Stores.“Those kiosks that just sell gallons and smokes are going to have to change” says Eichberger. “They’re going to lose gallons. Plain and simple no way around it.”He adds that the typical gas station of the future will likely look completely different from the fast paced “get ’em in get ’em out” stores of today. He thinks they will be more like restaurants or highway rest stops than convenience stores. Tesla is at the forefront of this paradigm shift in which customers stay longer and spend more. The more gas stations that move in that direction the better for Tesla.Tristen Griffith is the president of the Sacramento 49er Travel Plaza a truck stop that spent the past year researching EV technology. Recently Griffith made the decision to let a third-party company NRG Energy install a set of EV chargers on her commercial property.“We want to sell gas and diesel but our future is electric vehicles and trucks are going to be driverless” said Griffith. “Times are changing and we need to keep up with that change as well if we want to be smart and stay ahead of the game.”Staying ahead of the game is Tesla’s greatest strength. The question Tesla fans should be asking themselves at this point is exactly what does Tesla have in mind for charging the millions of electric cars it says it will be building in a few short years? Is it thinking about a parallel system to its Supercharger locations? Will it have one system for Tesla owners and another for drivers of other electric cars?We simply don’t know and won’t until Tesla decides to let us in on its plans.InterestingHot TradingHot Capital","EV Charging might come to Petrol Stations sooner than u think !!","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ev-charging-might-come-to-petrol-stations-sooner-than-u-think.2813373/?post_id=18281755","154","","15/07/16","17:11:44","","",""

That is if you estimate likely upside and downside on an IPO then calculate the Kelly Criterion it will give you an overly large percentage of your portfolio to bet on this opportunity. ( Particularly if you think the upside is a fair bit higher than the downside ) However I still find it a very useful tool when considering bet size to make.( As an example I recall when Aurizon listed several years ago. I spent a lot of time deciding bet size and the Kelly Criterion gave an even bigger suggested bet. I ended splitting the difference and it was most definitely to my advantage )","Re: Who picked these top 3 IPOs?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/who-picked-these-top-3-ipos.2812355/page-38?post_id=18281849","2601","","15/07/16","17:24:54","","",""

If we lost P&G now by providing unauthorised comments to the market where do you think we would be. We will win the process here and we have and are continuing to make outstanding progress with not only P&G but our other partners such that we are not totally dependent on one single partner and of course hopefully have multiple sources of income. That creates sustainable value and cash flows.We are very very mindful of disclosure but it has to be the right disclosure and I suggest we do more in responding to everyone's request for information than do most other companies.But great to have your continuing supportable and we will take note of your concerns as best we can.G.D.Sure i still hold but just not as many at this stage.","Re: Eye wand","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/eye-wand.2812950/page-10?post_id=18281855","1685","23","15/07/16","17:25:15","7.9¢","Hold","Held"

But in a lesson that could prove instructive across the world of commodities the rally in this ugly duckling of metals is unlikely to be enduring.Zinc prices are up 36% since the beginning of the year. That’s helped Vedanta’s share price nearly double aided by the company’s short-term fixes to its debt load.Now Vedanta is essentially doubling down on the stuff. Already a major producer the London-listed miner has dedicated half of its $1-billion capital expenditure for the coming year to zinc which is predominantly used in galvanized steel for cars and buildings.Vedanta’s outsized spending on zinc is a reversal from years of allocating an average 20% of capital to its zinc operations which have accounted for 30% to 50% of Vedanta’s earnings before interest depreciation and amortization.Vedanta’s move to get ahead of the zinc rush may seem prescient.Zinc has been an anomaly in the commodities market: It is expected to be in deficit for at least the next two years meaning there is more demand than supply.Vedanta is essentially restarting big plans it had before global miners went into cost-cutting mode. It dedicated $630 million to one of the world’s largest zinc deposits at Gamsberg in South Africa but later slashed expenditure to $400 million. It has spent just over $20 million on it in total. The miner last week reiterated its commitment to this project and says it plans to spend $200 million this year.Yet Vedanta’s existing zinc operations in India fell short of analysts’ production target last quarter. There have also been painful government approval processes and civil society backlash around its mines as well as a battle over retrospective taxes. In search of higher-grade ore Vedanta is moving from open-pit mining to more cost-intensive underground mining.AdvertisementIf Vedanta pins its hopes to a sustained recovery in zinc prices others may have the same idea. Last year a slew of zinc mines were shuttered. Glencore cut 4% of global zinc output by closing mines that were largely profitable on a cash basis according to Andrew Thomas at Wood Mackenzie.If Glencore started bringing back capacity Vedanta’s underperforming zinc mines could struggle further.And while zinc appears to be running in deficit that has actually been the case since at least 2012 according to Credit Suisse with hidden inventories getting released when prices rise even a little. As other commodities approach production levels that imply a deficit investors should be wary of the same cycle asserting itself.Vedanta’s bigger issue than zinc is its continuing battle with a bloated balance sheet. With that in mind it may serve Vedanta to tread carefully with zinc.","IBG in today'sWall St Journal","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ibg-in-todayswall-st-journal.2813398/?post_id=18281951","76","3","15/07/16","17:38:40","5.3¢","Buy","Held"

However this is probably not until AJX can demonstrate cash flow positive as this is the first requirement for most institutions to make an investment. The games being played currently do not work when there is more than 1 player. The question is will this (cash flow positive) be seen in this quarterly  September  December or not until 2017?","Re: Ann: Alexium Secures Long Term Work with Tenting Manafacturer-AJX.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-alexium-secures-long-term-work-with-tenting-manafacturer-ajx-ax.2812220/page-166?post_id=18281965","19021","8","15/07/16","17:41:45","71.5¢","Buy","Held"

This in itself is an interesting number as 100% is production of 350000t of spodumene concentrate from a current 2Mt/a plant. That means with certainty that the plan is to  high grade  it early. This is what most companies do in mining as it means paying off any debt quickly.One of the biggest questions over price received will relate to how many of the currently being built gigafactories are built and operating.From none now sometime next year the Tesla one is meant to start while the mega VW one will be an extra year or 2 into the future.Making an assumption that the LCE price is around the current level then first full year revenue would be around $350m while costs should be around $85m leaving a cashflow of $265m.Of this initial cashflow we will be paying for the construction of our half of the conversion plant somewhere in Asia with a cost of about $60m for our 50%. So plenty is left over should a bit of debt be needed to build the first plant and all the infrastructure that goes along with it.(I've noticed that we PLS have applied for a miscellaneous license over 11660 ha just to the west of our tenements so plenty of room for waste dumps tailings dams etc.)Assuming the conversion plant takes only a year to build and it sounds from the BOA announcement that GLC are very keen to get it going then to have enough concentrate for that plant as well as our initial commitments the next BOA possibly gives away how large the plant will be in the DFS. As soon as the next BOA is announced I will be adding numbers very quickly as a larger than 2Mt/a plant will see us grow very quickly.Thoughts people on the timing for any expansion? or any other numbers?Even if we start at 3Mt/a I would be assuming that expansion would be on the cards within 2 years as by 2020 the growth rate and price of lithium products should be really accelerating.","Building Success","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/building-success.2813405/?post_id=18282002","2776","58","15/07/16","17:47:47","62.0¢","Buy","Held"

Coventry’s primary asset is its right to acquire an 80% interest in the highly prospective high‐grade Caribou Dome Copper Project in Alaska USA (which is a stable pro‐mining jurisdiction). From their announcement on the 23rd of June: A second drilling rig has arrived at the Caribou Dome Copper Project to expedite the Company’s 8000m drilling programInitial drill‐testing of the very‐high priority Menel Target will commence immediatelyInitial drill‐testing of the very‐high priority Guardian Target will follow shortly thereafterThis second drilling rig will be used to immediately commence testing the very‐high priority Menel Target – a strong induced polarisation (“IP”) anomaly that coincides with strong copper‐in‐soil anomalism immediately along strike from the 700m‐long corridor of mineralisation drilled to date.Encouragingly while preparing to drill the Menel Target significant copper mineralisation has been mapped directly above and immediately along strike from the Menel IP anomaly  (It's basically popping out of the ground)Of their Guardian Target: Very encouragingly outcropping gossans were identified during follow‐up mapping; with rock chip samples assaying up to 16.5% copper And this: It is very encouraging that such mineralisation is present in close proximity to these high‐priority targets. The reason for the STT tip is this:The first drill rig has been working away since early June.  Drill core is being processed with initial assay results from the current drilling program expected in mid‐late July. With two rigs operating a steady stream of results is expected to follow. With Copper following along with many other base metals in increasing value hopefully we should see an increased interest in CYY. It also has a pleasant looking cup & handle type chart but I'm not even a novice when talking/looking about them so leave it for someone else to comment on that.Please double-check all the facts and figures and do your own research.","Re: Short Term Trading Weekend Lounge: 15 - 17 July","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/short-term-trading-weekend-lounge-15-17-july.2813317/page-43?post_id=18282058","5576","1","15/07/16","17:56:03","","",""

As it is the lightest metal it will be difficult for something better to come along for transport as most other materials are heavier and I haven't seen any suggestion of a hydrogen or helium battery. Plus at I stated somewhere else fuel cells just are not going to be able to compete against lithium batteries. The life time of the fuel stacks are not good worse than Li-on batteries plus there is the cost of hydrogen at the station compared being able to charge your car at home for free off the solar panels on your roof.The lithium batteries in 20 years time might be slightly different to today but I'm very confident they will still be a major part of society in 2036.","Re: Lithium Bubble ??","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/lithium-bubble.2811645/page-135?post_id=18282099","32286","6","15/07/16","18:01:51","62.0¢","Buy","Held"

It's disappointing when you consider Sydney kept Hawthorn goalless in the third Quarter excluding the free kick. I think it's even more disappointing when you consider that Hodge intentionally hit Gary Rohan who was on fire at the time whilst the play was downfield forcing him to come off the ground. No free kick and the comment from the umpire was 'leave it alone boys!'. Although the moment a Sydney play steps a metre off the mark which doesn't remove anyone from play and certainly was one of many occasions that players stepped off the line from both teams it results in a fifty-metre penalty. The punishment doesn't fit the crime in my mind. I don't think any umpire refereeing that game can realistically tell me that Hawthorn did not commit more than three free kicks over 90 minutes.","Re: Hawks by how much ??","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/hawks-by-how-much.2788955/page-342?post_id=18282106","12977","","15/07/16","18:03:09","","",""

All credit of course to reuters (not sure how in trouble you can get copying and pasting articles which are clearly linked above... hmm)Homepage  |  Thu Jul 14 2016 9:10am EDTLONDON  |  ByA rally in thermal coal prices over the past few months after years of decline should continue into next year but a cloud still hangs over the market in the form of weakening global demand due to more clean energy and increased energy efficiency.All major benchmarks for thermal coal have risen above $60 a ton in the past few weeks an increase of around 50 percent since record lows earlier this year due to output cuts supply disruptions and increases in demand in some parts of the world.Many analysts expect prices to keep gaining for the rest of this year and into some of next year but they will then likely go back into decline because the overall trend is one of global demand falling and production cuts could be difficult to enforce when prices are on their way up.The coal market has been oversupplied for years which dragged prices down by around 80 percent between 2008 and early this year forcing producers to cut back investment into new capacity and close unprofitable mines.China the world's biggest coal producer is restricting output to reduce a supply glut lowering output by 280 million tonnes this year as part of a wider plan to close 500 million tonnes of production in three to five years.Analysts at Citigroup expect Australia's thermal coal the Asian benchmark to rise further as the Pacific Basin market tightens due to Chinese output cuts and weak Indonesian exports. Falling European demand may also divert more coal to Asia. Adding fuel to the fire would be if rainfall due to La Niña was larger than expected affecting production in Australia and Indonesia quickly tightening the market  they said. Prices could even surge by 25 to 50 percent or up to $90/ton based on current prices. In late 2010/early 2011 a strong La Niña drenched coal production areas in Australia and Indonesia disrupting output and driving up prices to around $145/ton from $90/ton.CLOUD OVER COALDemand for coal from India Bangladesh South Africa Russia South Korea Indonesia and Australia is forecast to rise into next year as coal remains a cheaper alternative for producing energy but U.S. and European demand in particular will wane mainly due to cheaper gas. We remain bearish on the thermal coal market ... Demand has deteriorated further led by the seasonal decline of our EU Coal Burn Index. The profitability of coal-burning power stations in Europe (rather than gas) is now negative  said Georgi Slavov global head of energy iron ore and shipping research at Marex Spectron.In Europe demand is falling due to environmental regulations. In EU some countries such as Britain cheaper gas is squeezing coal out of the market. This is expected to continue and could drag European coal prices down around $40-50 a ton analysts said. In a counter-intuitive way the market is showing persistent tightness whereas coal demand is falling in most parts of the world  said Guillaume Perret director of coal iron ore steel and freight consultancy Perret Associates. We think the current rally is overshooting in a similar way as prices overshot on the way down in January 2016. It is not fueled by a genuine increase in demand but rather by a short- to medium-term delay for spare supply capacity to adjust to demand  he added.(Editing by David Evans)","Re: Thermal Coal on the rise?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/thermal-coal-on-the-rise.2810868/page-6?post_id=18282119","308","","15/07/16","18:05:17","18.0¢","Hold","Held"

I've also been in arguments before with women where I have become overly upset which I was not proud of. This is something that I am always conscious of and know that I must not ever lose control of myself. I'm quite confident I can do this as I think I've learnt well from these experiences and in any case I've never really been a violent person.Glad to see you controlled your emotions enough to avoid an altercation.PS. These altercation are but one area where DV happens.

Tinci or should I say their downstream companies have put the price of the lithium products up  by 350% between October last year and April this year with the excuse of building capacity.GLC will use all of the 140000t of spod concentrate.The company PLS has already done some scoping level studies with GLC on building a conversion plant where the cost is indeed over $200m for Poet Hedland yet in Asia they will be able to do it for around the $120m mark for the same sized plant. Hence why they are going to Asia outside China to build this plant and PLS will be contributing half the cost of about $60m.Your statement of them only selling 70000t is way off the mark and factually wrong. GLC are expanding their operations as the lithium market is an expanding one. They are currently getting ore from Albermarle who have already told customers 'no more' from 2017 so they will probably be spending a lot of next year expanding their plant waiting for our initial exports towards the end of the year or early 2018.You need to read the BOA announcement carefully to understand what is going on and have a uni student that van read reports in Chinese from these different companies to know what is really going on.Please stop saying that PLS are only selling 70000t as this is just wrong.","Re: Upcoming DFS & BOAs","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/upcoming-dfs-boas.2812583/page-32?post_id=18282198","9341","13","15/07/16","18:20:30","62.0¢","Buy","Held"

Some are just genuinely enthusiastic and want others to share in the money making opportunity that they have found ( but even then they will probably sell to you to move to freehold) . Some are more nefarious and will ramp it up on fundamentals only to dump into the volume and then blame the technicals for their change of heart. HC has been doing a reasonable job of identifying and banishing some of the worst of these.I have posted before that I do not trust anyone who posts multiple times on a thread in the one day unless it is banter or barney particularly if they rehash the same argument again and again. State the facts or your opinion and then move on.Have always had problems with the alleged holding downramper. Three times foolish they didnt get out at the right time having made that mistake they are loss averse and they denigrate their holding on a public forum. Always view them with suspicion.Facts are facts and opinion is opinion. Fail to see how a fact could be considered a down ramp. However it is rare that anyone just posts a fact. They usually extrapolate from that fact to offer opinions or judgements.The busier a thread is the less likely I am to post on it or even read it if there is not news being discussed/analysed. You only get the overcommitted  and the newbies there. Often it can be a real sign of too many HC's holding which does not provide a stable register imo.If someone wants to argue with me these days I will often just leave. It's not my job to make that person money and neither is it his to save me from my mistakes. There are some folks on HC that seem to have difficulty understanding how what they have written reads ( to give them the benefit of the doubt) and I find that if I engage I just get angry myself and I mean what is the point in that.That is why I only really post on threads occasionally these days and mainly read this thread and the BT.  Good balanced discussionseven if a bit too metal orientated for my interests atm.

Though the numbers aren't conclusive there were an estimated 1 to 3 million deaths from these campaigns. While some historians see the Crusades as a defensive action against Islamic conquest most see them as a papal-led expansion attempt by Western Christendom.Everyone has heard of the  Spanish Inquisition  but the Inquisition is actually a group of institutions within the Roman Catholic Church. Tracing back to the 12th-century the goal of the institutions is to combat secular sectarianism. Aimed at keeping it's own members  faithful  the Catholic Church began holding trials for those with non-mainstream beliefs within the church and for along period of time engaging in torture to coerce the individual to conform. In the cases where no repentance was received the death penalty was used as punishment. All in all there were an estimated 300000 people put on trial with about 6000 being executed.M+4This was undoubtedly the most evil disgusting institution in the history of mankind. How humans could be depraved enough to do these things to other humans in the name of God sickens me to no extent. As bad as every war in history has been nothing compares to the sick Satanic genocidal horrors committed by the inquisition in the name of the catholic church.MTo sum it up those who didn't follow what the church said including Muslims Jews and Protestants were found questioned and killed. This shows the corruption of the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.KKKIf they are Christians then they are Christians. Unlike atheists Christians are a cohesive group. If we don't count Christians because YOU DON'T AGREE then atheists have never killed anyone seeing as atheists have nothing in common never joined any atheist groups and don't all agree to the same beliefs. YOU put us in a group together not us. So if the the group you choose to belong to does not pertain to you then how can a group we never choose to belong to pertain to us?MHmm I see lots of atrocities on this page caused by Christianity But these atrocities really have NOTHING to do with Being A Christian at all the KKK were racists who killed people this has NOTHING to do with Christianity no where in The Bible does it say it is OK for a human to kill another human it is one of the Ten Commandments  Thou Shalt Not Kill  These people must have been non-practicing Christians at the least because they were not following God or The Bible when they carried out these atrocities. The Bible condemns murder & hatred.Initially religion was a motivation for the war as Protestant and Catholic states fought over what is now modern-dayand Italy. Involving most of the European countries it was one of the most destructive conflicts in European history with an estimated 3 to 11.5 million casualties.M+5This war destroyed a third of the population it caused starvation and disease. The landscape of Northern Europe was obliterated most forests were gone. It pretty much destroyed everything.","Re: How can the appeasers of Islam like our PM Turnbull defend this!","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/how-can-the-appeasers-of-islam-like-our-pm-turnbull-defend-this.2813264/page-39?post_id=18282226","2361","","15/07/16","18:26:56","","",""

On the flip side it could also cause more trouble than it's worth.I would suggest that you all keep conversations claiming one another as defamatory to a minimum and just concentrate on the stock information at hand.You are allowed to question and comment on the current progress of a stock in regards to JORC compliancy and the progress of a project but lets keep specific names of people out of it not to mention it's always best to air on the side of caution and state it's your opinion and not single any individual within the company out.Villageif you feel HC steps over the line report him. I will leave those reports for an independent (non-QBL posting) moderator such that you can have assurance that no bias goes into the decision. I understand that I have an opinion on QBL's progress to date as well as follow HappyCats (because he has a great depth of knowledge IMO) so I feel I should not be the one to sort out moderations on this thread.EveryoneRemember these things and you'll have an enriched life:1. take everyone's opinion as just that don't start believing in a hidden agenda or chasing ghosts2. if you're thinking about criticising the poster over their opinion think about why you disagree and post that instead. Don't post about the poster. More often than not people get into fights because both parties are settled on their own view before the argument began. Humans are pride-ful creatures. Don't let your pride get in the way of a healthy debate. Post facts pull from announcements or other data sources and show why your opinion was formed.3.Don't form your opinion around your monetary interest but rather form your monetary interest around your opinion.4. As mr delta said IGNORE is a function we put on here for a reason. If you feel someone is breaching your ability to apply the above IGNORE them. Simple.5. In general moderations won't be enforced for an opinion (positive or negative) about the stock if you feel the information is incorrect it is up to you (the users) to correct the information and show why you're correct.6. However (cont'd from 5.) if someone is spamming attacking posters posting low content ramps (up or down) or breaching any of the HC guidelines on profanity inappropriate images etc. Then we will moderate.Use the report button wisely and in the report reason put as much detail as possible as why you think it should be moderated. There are only a handful of moderators and we get 10000 posts a day.","Re: Ann: FORMAL NOTIFICATION RE MDL-QBL.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-formal-notification-re-mdl-qbl-ax.2810502/page-191?post_id=18282236","20173","6","15/07/16","18:28:46","0.8¢","None","Not Held"

Regardless as far as I know a Canadian oil company is producing oils there it seems no any restrictions to do exploration there imo.Cuba usually import crude oils from neighbour and allay Venezuela at discounted price and then refining them to export to Venezuela and its domestic consumption. But trouble is Venezuelans can not produce oils due to short of money and consequently Cuba is in big trouble as well due to short of petrol etc. All these situation indicates that Cuba needs desperately crude oils for themselves and likely to export to Venezuela.To deal with any projects there is priority in terms of 'choice and concentration' imo.All four projects look far less attractive than Cuba Block 9 which commercially size is world class urgency is requiredand most highly likely prospective due to its areas history proven oil producing cases.With no doubt not to disperse any company resources into under grade 4 projects and then putting intensive focus onBlock 9 with excessive resources (all available funds human powers and previous time) success will be guaranteed imo.Regards","Re: Ann: MEO July Open Briefing - Cuba Update-MEO.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-meo-july-open-briefing-cuba-update-meo-ax.2811401/page-23?post_id=18282238","4139","1","15/07/16","18:29:00","3.2¢","Buy","Held"

Paper loss of $6000 I think that's the point that Kev was making re the current options price. Normally options trade at discount ot he heads equal to that of the conversion price. There's always a little bit of a difference.As an asicde - some options tend to get cheaper close to the conversion date. Some option holders seemnot to have the dollars needed to convert. Rather than lose their entire investment - they trade them off for a discount. It can be a good time to buy if you have conversion dollars ready to goAnyway let's worry about that specific aspect closer to March 2019.The March 2019 is the last day that the options can be converted. They can be convereted at any time between when issued and the final date (March 31 2019). If not done by then they become void.That's my understadning of how options usually work.","Re: TV2- The next leg up (3c-5c)","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/tv2-the-next-leg-up-3c-5c.2796666/page-392?post_id=18282254","78686","4","15/07/16","18:30:51","2.9¢","None","Held"

I was buddying a new chum in my Aged Care job and almost every client today had an issue: needed to be sent to hospital; had been admitted to hospital but we didn't know; just returned from hospital (when clearly they should have been kept in there longer). And then there was the share market ...Checked my phone app after my first job at 9am to look at the preopen and saw GMR with Bids up to $0.02. For a moment I thought I had put in the wrong code. That PPP pump alluded to yesterday evening was real after all. Something to keep in mind for the future: if news on this list can generate that type of reaction it might be an idea to follow that list.With all the job weirdness today I made an executive decision to put in my Sell at $0.012. I was planning to hold until the acquisition but I couldn't ignore the chance for a 140% profit. Didn't get hit so I'm still holding and have decided to use a sliding stop now at $0.008 which guarantees me 60% and gives me a chance to ride the dragon until the acquisition news comes out.AAJ - well glad I bought at $0.011 a few days ago. Nice one. I'll use a sliding stop on this one as well and see how we go. Finished on 52 week high.Even VMC went up a bit so maybe the universe was being kind to me.My main short term interest is in SYA/O. Back trading on Tuesday after a CR with acquisition announcement due a few days later. I've yet to read through the announcement from today to get the gist of it.I'm looking forward to the weekend.

They can't right now not even close.

In 2016 Cameron placed a $280 million bid for Australia's oldest and largest dairy Van Diemen's Land Company dairy. Federal Treasurer Scott Morrison citing  national interest  instead sold the dairy to Moon Lake Investments a Chinese company. Another failed bidder for the dairy TasFoods was awarded $1.25 million in damages from Van Diemen's Land Company for breach of contract in regards to the sale. Cameron later stated that Morrison had  betrayed the future of Australians  as the sale was the latest during a public debate over foreign ownership of Australia's most fertile land.

There’s no gratitude to the societies that have given them succour just malice.”His comments came as the foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop confirmed three Australians were injured in the Nice attack.Malcolm Turnbull andBishop immediately condemned the attack stating that Australians were mourning for the “victims of another murderous act of terror in France overnight on Bastille Day”.Bishop confirmed that three Australians were among the injured though their injuries were thought to be minor.“We condemn this attack” Bishop said. “We support our friends and partners in France and we join with others around the world in hoping that this will be the end of this type of horrific incident that is targeted at unarmed civilians.”Bishop said the French government believed the attack had all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack.“Our ambassador has given me some insight into how this has been received in France” Bishop said.“It has shocked France it has rocked it to its core.”Bishop said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has reissued advice for Australians travelling to France recommending travellers exercise a high degree of caution.She said the Australian government would wait for the formal investigation to “take its course”.“This latest attack reminds us that no city no country is immune from terrorist attacks that’s why the Australian government will do all in our power to keep Australians as safe as possible both at home and abroad” Bishop said.","Abbott warns of 'creative' homegrown terrorism","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/abbott-warns-of-creative-homegrown-terrorism.2813444/?post_id=18282474","1704","9","15/07/16","19:08:04","","",""

I imagine if they have a stake in the four pillars at the moment of $400mil (current combined value including BFC's $100mil) that we need to see an approx 25% increase over the next 4 -5 years to be a $Billion Company.

Meaning are they meant to be kept for dividends or to be sold off to pay for bills.)This is where it becomes complicated because I remember reading that the Performance fee is also based upon the Value of the Combined Group.I think Dr Sexton needs to go back and reassess the dividend yield so it more aligns the interests of shareholders and Performance fee earners (which I believe mick z you said were the employees/managers of the local businesses who are paid in shares as bonuses or wages?)I seriously would like to see this work because Agriculture can be a difficult game.

Yes production cost numbers would provide an increase in the SP.However those selling today and yesterday are ST holders who got impatient.The company is making progress just not at the speed you would like. The KC video just posted mentions that they are currently working on reducing capex and mine design which long term will give shareholders the greatest return.One of the things I was initially concerned about after meeting with DR was how few personnel this company intially had on board. However I then realised this is one of the positives about EMH. They are looking for maximum SH value not wasting any $$ until necessary. No unnecessary raising of capital diluting SH value (unlike another Lithium stock with over a billion shares on issue) not jumping on the first processing route to come their way etc.If they needed cash desperately then they may have chosen to focus on releasing production cost numbers earlier to boost the SP. However they know they have enough $$ in the kitty to keep ticking boxes at their own pace. Long term shareholder value is their goal not short term bursts for ST holders. As long as we know the numbers by PFS then I don't see an issue.By that time our SP will be well north of where it is now and fund raising will be at a minimal dilution to SH.If you don't think lithium will be in demand for at least the next 10 years then you should be investing in currently producing miners.","Re: Ann: Pre-Feasibility Update-EMH.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-pre-feasibility-update-emh-ax.2812122/page-49?post_id=18282568","4810","8","15/07/16","19:22:25","41.5¢","Hold","Held"

Had a day out with the kids today and led to a newbie type mistake. I put all my KDRO parcel for sale after seeing it retrace from 10c to 8.6c at 9.2 when the heads were still falling after early peak. Thinking there was going to be more of a slide and I would have opportunity to buy back in cheaper later. With intermittent free wifi found my order had been hit but that the price at that point was back up to 10c. Finished the day at 15c. Was gutted initially and disappointed in myself for leaving the order without being able to follow it up but at the end of the day it is good to talk about leaving money on the table taking a profit for once rather than selling out for a loss.Also free carried myself on GMR as well as pocketing a bag's worth so all in all a good day.Happy to post some charts up over the weekend but may not get to them straightway given it is school holidays etc. Just tag me.

The vast majority of Australia is as unprotected as Pt. Arthur was way back then.

I think from memory in the annual reports they still hint that a dividend will be contemplated down the track though. Perhaps they want to increase the size of the fund first a bit more. They are doing this via good performance to some extent now. As they are very active in making takeovers in the past it wouldn't surprise me to see them also one day taking over a company via scrip merger again to increase size. For that they would want their shares trading closer to NTA though in the first place! Size is also needed to reduce the INA weight which also might put off potential investors who want a more diversified LIC.Retail investors have a massive obsession with dividends and that is a major factor of the shares trading at such a discount in my opinion.The other factor is simply the lack of promotion on the stock from management. For example no fancy 5 page monthly investment report and commentary about all their positions.Personally I am not that fussed with the above as this in part creates a better opportunity to get into the stock. I would ideally own this for quite a while so am in no rush but eventually a dividend would be handy. I doubt they will do more promoting the stock.Interestingly when they formed this entity early on I remember there was a bit initial fanfare about Ron Brierley and it traded at a large premium to NTA.","Re: share price","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/share-price.2794206/page-8?post_id=18282733","341","","15/07/16","19:48:19","14.5¢","Buy","Held"

Having dealt with large corporations in my day to day work you have to understand the hoops that need to be jumped through. As an example just to get on the payroll as an approved supplier can take up to 6 months and then another 6-9 months from there to be paid as you enter their billing cycles. That's one year just to get paid for a piece of work. Another example is trying to get one bit of data displayed on a system. It can take 3 months of back and forth between departments to agree whether that's allowed what font it needs to be in etc...We're talking about a global rollout for a product here. Seeing some posters complain that a license deal hasn't been completed yet just tells me you have unrealistic expectations. That's putting it politely. And I am not singling you out here Desco. So many others more worthy of directing this paragraph and post to.It's taken a while to get here and that doesn't surprise me one bit. Recent Ann's putting a 90 day timeframe on it tells me there's a push from higher up to get this across the line asap. Somebody's bonus is tied to this kpi in some way... I wouldn't be surprised if they miss the 90 days but when legal gets involved on both sides - things will drag on.In terms of swot - one of the biggest dangers with a large multi is that your project is one in a list of hundreds and thousands. Typically you have a key sponsor who believes in the project and who you have a good relationship with. If they leave or there's a restructure and budgets shift etc. it doesn't matter how good the project is - it can fall over. Investors should take comfort in the growing number and scope of work plans. It means more parties are getting involved and provides a greater level of safety. Doesn't mean it can't still all fall in a heap but the moat is a little bit bigger.So everyone needs to chill and be patient. I've been here since the days when surges was championing obj. Have traded some but still hold many. It is one of my more comfortable holds and I get more comfortable each time more work plans and depts get involved... We (the supplier) do not dictate the terms and speed at which things get done.","Re: SWOT - OBJ","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/swot-obj.2813083/page-7?post_id=18282747","1827","29","15/07/16","19:50:20","7.9¢","None","Held"

They haven't in the past done a lot until zinc settles over $1 per lb. We're not there yet. Even when we do we have to expect some fatigue - we've been there a couple of times in the recent past and zinc price has failed to stay above $1.Punters have to decide for themselves whether this time will be different or not and this is where analysis of the fundamentals kick in. I argue for what it's worth that this time it is real but isn't happening on a straight line basis - no problems there the trend is fairly convincing.Zinc stocks will react when the market decides this time it is real. Mining approval has been ongoing for years and we are so very close. Again people have to make their own decisions on this.Your condition eastwest of  clear legal direction in which they could be allowed to mine then I would be very interested but at the moment it's an awesome orebody stranded in an uncertain jurisdiction  is the least of my concerns. The jurisdiction is fine they are screaming for it. Not sure what legals you would be worried about.My biggest concern would be other projects coming on line before we do - comforting is that like Dugald River they will take time to impact. The market is incapable of calculating the timing of new supply vs zinc price now and for the next couple of years as we heads towards that shortage.I believe once the market is satisfied the zinc price is going to stay above $1 zinc stocks will motor. Mining approval will add that extra boost. For me it is just timing.In the meantime IBG will inch up as it has from the 3's to the 5's. At some point if zinc stays above $1 IBG will motor if the past is anything to go by.","Re: Zinc Today","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/zinc-today.2810200/page-38?post_id=18282856","4628","6","15/07/16","20:08:18","5.3¢","Buy","Held"

If you make it through the 28 days without your woman being insulted and called a slut or one of their little grubs trying to rob you you will do well.I have heard countless stories from relatives about Arab kids openly saying at school how much they hate France. We ve bent over and taken it and given them EVERYTHING. Any western country is better than the sheet hole where they come from but that s still not enough.My niece s school even introduced allal for all kids without notifying the Christian parents first.They cant celebrate Christmas and Easter anymore because we can't offend muslims at school there are calls to have the equivalent of the HSC outside of Ramadan because Arab kids are at a 'disatvantage' (not like education should take precedence anyway) and the list goes on and on. You want to know how they feel about you just watch the highlights of France-Algeria a few years ago in Paris absolute scum. They have no respect for the hand that feeds them...in this case literally given the amount of welfare they get.This might all be new to you guys in Australia but France first had to deal with Islamist terrorism in the early 90s when the FIS from Algeria brought their f@&$ing civil war into French territory. So when I hear Hollande say that we have to learn to live with terrorism I can only shake my head in despair. As far as I can remember nobody has been allowed to park in front of schools in France since god knows how long for fear of terrorism so we bloody know how to live with it.We knew we had a problem the left allowed a stack of them in then allowed them to bring their family and extended family.

The tearing down of the Berlin Wall is one of the greatest moments in human history. Russia is now so impoverished by the arms race that it will take a long time for its economy to recover.Communism was a religion that was harsh and cruel. It murdered more people than any other ideology in the history of mankind. The atrocities committed in the name of Marx and Lenin can only be compared to Hitler and his Third Reich who fine-tuned mass murder into an art form.In the flush of victory the West in general and Americans in particular assumed that peace had finally been established on earth. A new world order of peace prosperity and unity was just around the corner. We can safely dismantle our military and disarm our missiles of mass destruction. The threat to world peace is over. We can now relax our guard and rest in the confidence that World War III will not happen in our lifetime.Thus the world is lulled to sleep while an old Enemy of truth justice peace and democracy gathers its strength for an all out offensive against the civilian populations of the West. This old Enemy has attacked the West before. Its armies invaded Europe on several occasions and even reached Vienna Austria.This evil force destroyed everything it touched and left only mangled corpses and burned cities behind it. Its blood thirst and genocide campaigns far exceed any atrocities committed by the Nazis and the Soviets. These enemies of all that is good and righteous can kill innocent women and children without mercy and shame.They have stated time and time again that their great goal is the subjugation of the entire world to the civil laws totalitarian political forms and cultural norms dictated by their religion. Instead of religion being the tool of the state the state is the tool of religion.This requires the destruction of all other religions especially Christianity and Judaism. And throughout history whenever they had the political means to suppress other religions they did so with religious zeal.This ancient enemy of freedom is the religion of Islam. It imposed itself in and beyond the Arabian Desert through wars of violence and political intimidation. It views all that is not Islam as Satan.In this light it makes no sense whatsoever for the West to be disarming while Islam is arming. While we are dismantling our missiles and nuclear warheads Islamic nations are buying and building intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of showering nuclear death on any city in Europe or America.We stand in some ways like those few brave Americans and Europeans who just before World War II warned people of the Nazi threat to world peace. They took the rhetoric of Hitler at face value and saw the buildup of war and terrorism across the world. While others dismissed Hitler and his 'brown shirts' as buffoons a few people sounded the alarm. Sad to say their warnings were ignored.  Peace in our time  was Chamberlain's swan song and the world was lulled to sleep while the Third Reich armed itself for war.We are in much the same situation today. The Muslim threat to the peace and security of America is as real as was the threat of Nazism and Communism. If God does not intervene the day will come when a mushroom cloud will appear over a major American city signaling death and destruction unparalleled in U.S. history.The apostle Paul warned us that if the trumpet is not blown loud and clear the people will not prepare for war (1 Corinthians 14:8). Ezekiel tells us that we are watchmen who have the responsibility to warn the city of an approaching army of death and destruction. If we fail to warn people of the coming war with Islam their blood will be on our hands (Ezekiel 33:1-6).In order to convince people that Islam constitutes a clear and present danger to the peace of the world we must first demonstrate that Islam has the will and the desire to destroy us and second that they now have the means to do so.The Qur'an commands its followers to launch jihads or holy wars of conquest to force conversions to Islam.SurahSurahSurahAt the beginning Muhammad's armies attacked defenseless caravans during times of truce and peace. He then sent out his armies to conquer and loot small villages. Cities were later put under the sword. Ultimately entire nations fell to the sword of Islam. Entire populations were slaughtered and great cultural treasures were either looted or destroyed. (For the documentation: see the book The Islamic Invasion Harvest House Eugene OR)Whereas Jesus told his disciples to put away their swords Muhammad commanded his followers make war in his name. Recorded in the Hadith the second most important duty in Islam according to Muhammad is Jihad or Holy War.The blood lust of Islam is thus rooted in a perverted religious impulse to kill and mutilate in the name of Allah. This is what makes it so insidious and wicked. The killing of innocent men women and children in the name of Islam becomes a thing of praise and a badge of honor. The more you kill the more Allah is honored. The greater the destruction the greater the glory of Islam. Listen carefully to what the most influential leaders of Islam have said.Koranic- Ayatollah Khomeini   The U.S. is the devil on this planet.

I assume the good ones are organised through company ambassadors so I just read the bad ones. Need to adjust for the fact that people are more compelled to write a review when they need to vent. However looking through the reviews they are a bit dated. Thinned out in March and April and not much after that. If they are growing and acquiring new users you’d think some of them would like to complain?So I compared Thursdays update to the previous one on 29April:Colleges Added: 125 in 1st qtr to total 1250 colleges at end of March. Then reported adding 125 in “6 months” to June to total 1250 today! i.e. they added no colleges in June qtr and selectively spun this.Downloads (First Launches): March qtr had 200000 downloads to total 703000. June qtr added 17000 to total 720000 to date. So app download growth effectively stalled in June. Could just be seasonal factors.High schools: Website claims “4600 US middle and high schools”. Latest update says “3500+ high schools” Is that going backwards or just a bit too much license given to their marketers on the web?So what went wrong in the June qtr?. No colleges added downloads stalled app reviews dried up high school numbers now 24% less than previously promoted. I noticed they also lost three Directors in the June qtr; Hindery Rhoten Hauser.  It was a bad quarter for them but nice spin to make the latest announcement read so positively. Need to investigate how the new app fits in.High volume now two days in a row capping price. This stock had a 1 for 1 cap raise in April with unlisted options attached. Firstly that sort of dilution where you double the number of shares affects the chart and its ability to climb back to previous levels as every price level on the chart needs double the effort to get back there given twice as many shares. However I suspect holders are now selling down their heads when they get the chance of a bit of volume appearing and just holding the unlisted options in case of upside. They can’t be sold anyway.

One thing that caught my eye today was this -Good heading for an article right (a little sensational with a tint of possible truth) only if you read the entire document did it sink in for me that its a very similar event to Brexit. Not necessarily in the sense that Italy would just leave the European Union/ the Euro but more so that it was tipping towards such an event. I don't think the markets even need to have an actual second exit just the possibility of one to go into some form of meltdown.In regards to the 'big picture' I think that the market movements right now smack of total and utter support by the central banks. The the U.S economy is very weak the Japanese is weak China is weak in fact ever major economy has low or stagnating growth. The POG is not going to go up in a straight line at least until such a time as what I expect to happen but don't actually want to happen (the next financial crisis that makes the great depression look like a minor correction) as in the end everyone is going to face the consequences of such a even even those who are most prepared. So what if the U.S markets make new highs the markets always go too high and too low I am confident that it is definitely not the later.Totally agree the POG in USD has risen approx 25% from its lows last year not a bad start. Investors are not IMHO the main players in the markets these days its bots funds traders. I am not delusional in that I could possibly make more money if I traded but I do believe that if I continue to hold well run precious metal stocks I will do as well as possible in the coming years. Hence in the end my conclusion to this mini essay is that right now its all white noise.

Although the timing caught the participants a bit by surprise the ‘give away’ price accepted by COP was equally odd. It doesnt surprise me too much as once a major has decided to ‘out’ something timing is usually more important than value. Where COP will look even more foolish is when commerciality is declared fairly soon I think and when one or more of the other parties increase their resource estimates also fairly soon. For Cairn who have how you say been quite slow off the mark to appreciate value here they will lose operatorship to WPL but gain as the development gets going much more quickly. For Far still massively geared to the discovery the upside despite being dented yesterday still looks huge. They are fully funded for anything that can be thrown at them two wells this year perhaps and plenty of technical and administrative work to do into the bargain. Despite being caught by surprise I still think upside in Far can be well above 25c a share.

In eighteenth-century London the spectacle of a hanging was not simply a form of punishing transgressors. Rather is evidently served the more sinister purpose - for privileged ruling class - of forcing the poor population of London to accept the criminalization of customary rights and new forms of private property. Necessity drove the city's poor into inevitable conflict with the changing property laws such that all the working-class men and women of London had good reason to fear the example of Tyburn's triple tree. In this new edition Peter Linebaugh reinforces his original arguments with responses to his critics based on an impressive array of historical sources. As the trend of capital punishment intensifies with the spread of global capitalism The London Hanged also gains in contemporary relevance.","Re: Eye Movements","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/eye-movements.2803596/page-18?post_id=18283285","536","1","15/07/16","21:27:30","","",""

Theto Reddit and Tesla confirmed withthat a customer-focused launch event will occur that night.The Gigafactory won’t likely be fully completed within the next two months but Tesla has been hosting smaller events in areas of the factory where construction is complete. Tesla-0.45%  and SolarCity1.78%  hosted Nevada’s legislators for talks about the future of solar in the state.The factory which will cost at least $5 billion to build was only 14% completed as of the beginning of May. Tesla is working with Panasonic to supply it with battery production equipment and part of the funding.Despite that there’s ongoing construction at the factory it’s alreadythat Tesla is selling to utilities companies and building owners. These batteries which Tesla introduced a year ago can be used to store solar energy at night and better manage the power grid.Tesla is building the Gigafactory to produce massive amounts of low cost batteries for its electric cars of the future. Through mass production Tesla is hoping to lower the costs of its batteries by at least a third.Tesla’s next car the Model 3 is supposed to cost $35000 compared to its $80000 to $150000 Model S and Model X cars. A chunk of that cost savings is supposed to come from batteries made in the Gigafactory.Last month Teslathe Model 3 and quicklyfor the car. To meet the high demand Tesla has said it will speed up production of the car considerably.Tesla raised $1.7 billion this week in a follow-on offering to fund its accelerated manufacturing of the Model 3.The battery equipment used in the Gigafactory is supposed to double the world’s. The factory itself will cover 5.8 million square feet.","Re: Gigafactory; July 29th 2016.","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/gigafactory-july-29th-2016.2813470/page-2?post_id=18283365","221","4","15/07/16","21:44:01","0.4¢","Buy","Held"

I quickly saw that what they taught was very different to mainstream religion. I found it agreed with my wife's Bible. The last thing I wanted to do was get involved with a religion that required preaching but there was no getting around that is what is expected of Christ's disciples so that's what I now do as often as I am able.As regards the need to be taught the Scriptures make it clear. Christ's disciples were ALL to teach unbelievers. Within the congregations teaching is reserved for those with the needed qualifications.(James 3:1) Not many of you should become teachers my brothers knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.1 Timothy 3:1-7. The overseer should therefore be ... qualified to teach1 John 2:27 that you quoted  the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you  speaks of the situation with the 'anointed '. It makes it clear that no one is needed to teach these that they have been anointed and are therefore of the select few that will rule with Christ Jesus in heaven.John 14:26 was assuring those Jesus taught that they need not worry about their memory failing them. Those that wrote the Scriptures for example were enabled by holy spirit to recall accurately the things they had been taught.These Scriptures do not support the idea of a lone ranger getting the truth outside of Jehovah's organisation.(Acts 2:42) And they continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles ....(Acts 2:47) At the same time Jehovah continued to add to them daily those being saved.","Re: Hell -just another myth?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/hell-just-another-myth.2798683/page-70?post_id=18283454","2382","","15/07/16","22:06:04","","",""

My earlier chart didn't have the first and second dashed red warning lines drawn and so when I noticed the price retrace from 25.5c just after open back to 22c I assumed the price would head down further to test the green median and second yellow warning line due to all the hits on the yellow fork previously. Hence the decision to sell the KDRO to see if I could get back in later at a lower price.I was also pretty happy with myself for going through with a take profit on GMR earlier in the day (I have previously let a multi bagger fall back into a loss position in my first tilt at the market thinking if it got there once it will do it again) and I guess I had my sell finger primed and ready to go. My mistake that I could have controlled ( I can't control or predict the price action) was to put the whole parcel up for sale rather than 40 or 50% just in case there was some upside.

These were the people that bought early and will obviously do the same in other facets of electricity/batteries/vehicles.Just before the end of the financial year we paid for a 6kw off grid system for a shed on the farm right next to the orchard the panels grid tied inverter and off grid sunny Island inverter cost all up was cheaper than the original 5kw system for the house 5 years ago now but with so much more. The off grid sunny island inverter is not cheap. for batteries I'm waiting for the new LG ones that come out next week but will wait for a few months before purchasing them.When our PFIT finishes we will be adding solar panels and batteries for peak hour consumption but it will be a couple of years before we buy an EV. We are basically waiting for the variety of choice to get better which by 2020 it certainly will be.Then I'll put MORE solar panel on the carport roof to charge the first EV!!

The above uses a spreadsheet and it took more than the 5 minutes the first cut did and is still purely on a merger basis but shows the percentage holdings for FMS holders doesn't really change and even with this idea the FMS holder still hold the key to a possible take-over offer in the future of an SoA for that matter.So a TIO merger as suggested by is possibly a smart move and it would get you mobilised but still allow you to retain some control of your own destiny with OCJ having a clear margin over the 10% threshold (or 90% take-over threshold to use the reverse logic and also applying a reduction to any possible 15% private placement) and even FMS United would still have a strong say with its percentage holding so worst case you are not left in the hands of other parties.","Re: Contact Twiggy ASAP","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/contact-twiggy-asap.2813162/page-16?post_id=18283486","1460","1","15/07/16","22:17:23","2.5¢","None","Not Held"

Ie. News  hype hot asset and so on.The higher the  share price the Lower the premium gets on the options.The heads At 10c. The option will be at least 7.5 c  if Yu buy options at 1.2c that's 650% increase from 1.2c to 7.5cWe're as the heads will be 330 % increase at 10c from 3c.So Yu see it can cost you half the money outlet on the options to make the same return.So if I buy 100.000 heads at 3 c will cost 3k when I sell ar 10c it's worth 10kIf I buy  roughly 3k options at 1.1c will 270k shares sell at 7.5c it's worth 20kSo same outlay I double my profits with share price at 10c if I don't have the cash or I need the extra cash I sell my 3k worth of heads and buy 1.5k worth of option that way I have less skin in the game but with the same upside.In my opinion the options are about right because of such a long expiry and because the share price is not far of its lows with expected good news in the short time.VERY IMPORTANT THE SAME IS TRUE WHEN THE SP GOES SOUTH THE OPTION WILL SUFFER MORE.There the risks when buying options is share price goes to 2c options will be worth in my opinion .006cSo a 30% decreSe in heads will see a 50 to 60 % decrease in options.Keep in mind if your outlay is only half on the options as what it would have been on the heads ie. 1.5k worth of options instead  of 3k worth of heads your loss in dollar terms will be the same weather on heads or options.I personally have sold my heads and taken half that coin and put on options that way I have the other half free cash to go play on others or be free to trade the heads without worrying about being caught out on a trading halt.that's just me that's how I roll I'm happy to let them sit such a long time before expiry the share price could be anywhere in 3 years time. 1$  5$ Or  5c 1c who knows.May even convert to heads and let sit for plus 12 mths. All depends on tv2 and we've there headed.Also from my experience placement holders almost always sell the there heads and hold the options for free carry I try to do the same when I can the ones that do well do very well.Before I go if you don't understand the options then it's much safer to stick with the heads less volatile easier to price easier to trade just my opinion.As for tv2 I have big hopes but way to much secrecy and discreet enacts in there announcement for me to gobig on them I'm still not satisfied in there transparency. My 500k options will be enough for as the game stands now.

That was about two years ago now.  Each time the share price would jump between 50% and 200% and then settle back to slightly lower than the starting point.  So this stock has form for pump&dump.But as I pointed out in another post early today (Friday) there are differences between then and now so don't hang your hopes on a retracement...1) We have cash now and didn't before so before there was the necessity of dilution.  Doesn't apply now.2) Gold price had crashed and miners were shelving operations not bringing new ones on.  Zinc is hot at the moment!So if you sold and are looking to climb aboard again or if you waited too long and missed the 0.5c level and are waiting for a good entry price I would suggest that you consider average in rather than committing to a price point.  Maybe take some at 1c on Monday so if it shoots away without falling lower at least you have some tickets for the ride.  Consider taking some more at 0.8c.  If you have the cash for it you might even keep some in reserve in case we fall back to 0.6c.","Re: Ann: Acquisition Update-GMR.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-acquisition-update-gmr-ax.2805852/page-142?post_id=18283579","16954","1","15/07/16","22:47:24","1.0¢","Hold","Held"

It would be a surprise if the cupboard was completely bare and certainly something the authorities should investigate if it turns out that way.And they do hold a chunk of AJQ shares purchased from holders although admittedly probably only 10% of the value we originally hoped to receive.I figure AEP will be looking for the most cost effective option to exit this deal.I don't know who AEGP's directors are but if they are all Americans it may be winding up is the most expeditious exit even if they end up forfeiting their AJQ shareholding. If there are local directors in there they will be more likely to want avoid that approach as an adverse finding in a liquidation could tarnish reputations. So in that case we might see them trying to find a way to off-load their responsibilities.It is worth remembering they hold a ticket to potentially control 20% of AJQ.If you were a Chinese company seeking to take AJQ over on the cheap you could accumulate 20% of AJQ then make an offer to AEGP for their parcel on the understanding they would not have to proceed with the farm-in if the take-over was successful. That would likely find a willing seller.How much they would have to offer to get to 50% is an open question but I suggest less than the 20c offered in the recent past.That is bad news if you bought in during the initial float or end of last year take over run up but there has been no shortage of opportunity to average down. My guess is the next month or two will see this come to a head and if you need to average down to get out square with say a 20c bid you might want to consider it.Of course I say this with a bunch of cynicism. I would much prefer to see AJQ stay the course develop their assets and become the first of a new generation of gas producers that end up outshining Bass Strait. But I suspect the depressed stock price failing partner and possibly circling vulture buyer will end up with this one.","Re: Ann: Court Rules in Favour of Armour in NT Farm-out Dispute-AJQ.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-court-rules-in-favour-of-armour-in-nt-farm-out-dispute-ajq-ax.2813007/page-11?post_id=18283630","996","2","15/07/16","23:01:51","7.5¢","Buy","Held"

So if they get to 90% as long as they convert these to GXY shares (1.65 ratio min 75%) they can force GMM holders to accept the offer then delist GMM.This is an off market bid so GXY can set conditions. One of the conditions they set is that if they get to 80% and then with GMM's approval they can (not will) accept the 80% converting these shares to GXY shares.Those GMM shareholders that didn't accept will still own their shares albeit GXY will be the major shareholder holding 80% + of the GMM issued shares thus having control of the company. They cannot force those remaining GMM holders to accept the offer.If they don't get to 80% all bets are off. They can extend the takeover offer (up to a year) vary the conditions (existing acceptances still get the benefits) or just walk away from it - those GMM shareholders that accepted the offer get their GMM shares back.","Re: GMM Merge: Everyone needs to vote...

Would change fisheries in between seasons rather than go surfing in Indo like many others. Sea-time accrued much faster which served me well for getting ticketed earlier and leaving the nets and bait earlier too.

Then there are issues like the Deutsche bank and the stress tests (which I believe is coming up) then you have things like the Japanese elections which ensured that Abe is now able to try out almost whatever he likes monetary policy wise... Of course I also think things like the U.S jobs report is important but.... perhaps less so as compared to some of the events I mentioned. Simply because the U.S markets seem to focus so much on the day to day they simply ignore the big ticket items unless they actually go against what the U.S media (I say that because it pretty much a one-fits-all view) expects.Even Zerohedge seems to not quite have this sort of calendar (even though they touch on pretty much everything I have mentioned) they produce so many articles that for me at least it takes a lot of effort to sift though it all and even then I am yet to produce any truly organised timeline. I know a couple of other posters wiser than me also seem to think this particular tool (if I can call it that) does not exist in a form that is some what prescient (yes that may be asking a lot but... there are some extremely intelligent people out there).Perhaps I am asking too much? I am not a trader so I don't really want such a tool but I would have thought many would. I would just enjoy using such a tool to see if predictions come right events unfold as perhaps they have in the past (history repeating itself) etc.Most importantly I hope you son gets better.","Re: Gold price","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/gold-price.2748389/page-3552?post_id=18283745","591804","2","15/07/16","23:39:53","47.0¢","Buy","Held"

If they come up with the goods then they have earned their options.They might have been surprised by the speed of the deal but I think they knew there was something in the air all along and (as Phillip said) they won't be altogether cold.

When I first come on here I was beginning to think I had been asleep for 500 yrs and the world had changed = I was stunned at what some people had in their minds haha. And it still never ceases to amaze me.Well wotsup you are showing your complete ignorance & restrictive boundaries of your earthbound mind..I can only assume you have never dreamt of anything in your sleep. For your info dreams are of the astral plane realm - so if it happens you & maybe a couple of your grand kids have had a dream or 2 'all of your minds were 'off with fairies' - please do some more homework because your mind is as I type. stuck on the earth plane.Commonly applied to the chaotic impressions which memory transmits to our consciousness at the moment of waking which are but a small part of the dreaming which goes on during the sleeping period and which is not recollected. To a large extent dreams are a reflex of our sensory impressions and of our thoughts during the waking state; the principles concerned in these cases being kama and the lower aspect of manas which act and react with the various nerve centers and the organs at the base of the brain. But if the word dream is to be distinguished from dreamless sleep on the one hand and waking consciousness on the other it must include a far higher kind of dream which is the experiences of the higher aspect of manas. These experiences being so different from those of the waking state cannot be transmitted to the latter except symbolically or in distorted form.The astral light also plays an enormous part in most dreams. We may witness scenes which cannot have formed part of our waking experience and evidently in this case are seeing pictures in the astral light which we correctly or erroneously connect with our own personality. Again with prophetic dreams our vision untrammeled by physical senses perceives in the astral light the image of what will later happen on the physical plane and we may occasionally carry a recollection of what has been seen into the waking state.Perhaps you should google 'sleep walking' & you may discover why it can be dangerous to startle someone who is sleep walking .Sleep tight !!","Re: What is the Purpose of Organic Life on Earth ?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/what-is-the-purpose-of-organic-life-on-earth.2806329/page-217?post_id=18283778","6834","","15/07/16","23:52:05","","",""

Hard road to hoe when they can (with reasonable justification) claim that it was the collapsing oil price that soured the deal plus McClendon's death.I'd rather be AJQ than AEP. But I'd rather be Westside than DGR.My personal belief is management should pursue other avenues to develop the holdings. There are plenty of companies that will be looking for growth opportunities shortly given the collapse of exploration expenditure across the sector. It would be good to be in the front of mind of some of the bigger oilers. Our management and board has the experience and relationships to do that.We have an opportunity to fund our existence with the Origin assets likely enough to keep us going when things are tough (if we work out a commercial way to pay for them!) but we need capital to develop the big assets.It will be a long road if we hope to self-fund development so I don't see that as a real option. The Origin assets raise a handy bit of cash flow when we get them back online but they were mainly bought for their ability to add value to our bigger holdings through gas storage for arbitrage access to processing and pipeline facilities and potential crew facilities. At least that is my view. We might find further ways to extract value too with a workover of the fields with modern drilling but there is no billion barrel oil field hidden there.I wish this stuff was all coming to a head in a USD$100/barrel oil price environment but we have the cards we have been dealt.  I firmly think we will be looking at 100%+ appreciation from these depressed levels but likely to get bought out at a 50% loss for original IPO holders. Which I think is very disappointing.I'm open to ideas/theories that go against this grain and show us building our financial capability and developing our exploration assets so don't hold back!","Re: Ann: Court Rules in Favour of Armour in NT Farm-out Dispute-AJQ.AX","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-court-rules-in-favour-of-armour-in-nt-farm-out-dispute-ajq-ax.2813007/page-13?post_id=18283781","996","1","15/07/16","23:52:33","7.5¢","Buy","Held"

I have owned for 5 years and occasionally averaged down after initially buying in @ about double the current price. So happy days are here again!Looks like CSS are finally starting to get it together - agree with some other posters about the exciting LT potential of this company however holding this stock has been a really wild ride. In hindsight the tuna breeding program consumed way too high a % of their budget. You need a stable base which to build off right? So CSS need to be cashflow positive first get a nice little bank balance going on pay off any debts etc - hopefully Kingfish will offer this (looks very promising). Once we have it maybe CSS Management can start to dip their toes back into the water re: tuna breeding? I'd like to see them do it but it needs to be baby steps - can't lose sight of the core business and despite the company name this isn't tuna!RE: the feedstock claim I would be suprised if we see the $30M - thinking it'll likely be settled for less. There's 2 schools of thought for Claims - either aim for the stars and you might get to the moon (in this case you lose a lot of credibility in the eyes of the people who know the details - but many people/companies don't seem to care if they get the financial result they were after? If the CSS Claim is in this boat it'll likely settle for substantially less than $30M) and the 2nd second method is be very factual and reasonable with your claim (if the CSS claim is in this boat it'll settle much closer to the $30M than the 1st example). Which one did they submit? I have no idea but I guess we'll find out. I am assuming they had language in the feed supply Contract terms and conditions that the feed should contain a certain concentration of the required nutrients for fish propagation? If they mentioned taurine specifically they should have a really good case. If they didn't will be harder to prove but certainly not impossible. I am assuming that since CSS Management have come this far and submitted the Claim they think they have a pretty good case. Would be nice to get a good chunk of $ back - this was a real body blow at the time and I thought for a while that CSS would go broke.Well good luck to all longs and congrats to Management for turning our Company around!

Thus they would accept WPL coming on board (price taker)  and prep for ongoing costs to production.Going into producrion they may realise some value as the prospect matures from further appraisal and better offers come through (or taken out by WPL). Alternatively they find funding for production (say through forward sales).Above may be an alternative longer term look on value returned for shareholders for FAR being unable to cash in on the pre emptive option. As mentioned this will likely dissapoint a lot of shareholders (incl. myself) but probably not the end of the world.Regarding the idea of fast tracking production this might only be a year shaved off from the original timing indicated.

I sold the large majority of my shares straight after the video release. Quite frankly it was a shocker and we all know it. I have now sold all of my shares.  There were and are too many unanswered questions I'm afraid. Couldn't reconcile the whole 'production of video - weather permitting' claims. Seemed misleading to me especially considering that the video was filmed entirely inside. Unless I am wrong Kantor has basically confirmed that this version of the ROAM-e will be an indoors device. Some with more technical expertise have lamented that the device will struggle to remain stable in any sort of breeze. Unfortunately we have nothing to prove those folks wrong.  Is that why they only filmed inside? I suppose we won't know for some time yet. The whole indoor filming was inconsistent with their previous statements ladies and gents. The other thing that troubles me at this point is the number of drone-type devices that are out there or close to production that do similar things to those claimed by ROAM-e. That fact alone will put significant pressure on the ROAM-s generating any significant sales IMHO. I could be wrong but I doubt it.It is also an ominous sign that the SP has fallen below the CR figure of 7c. Unless they are about to pull a rabbit out of their hat they might be in even more poo next week. Will take a big set of jacobs to buy in at this point.

This stock trades on fundamentals and there's none more important than that at the moment.A clear $15-20 USD million profit this Quarter or EOFY would be a fantastic start so that we know they can meet both the upcoming $5 million December debt payment and the June 2017 $15 mil in one hit. Then of course that would give them an entire year and a bit to work on pooling the $30 million payment due in December 2017 and for the whopper amount due in 2018.Also now even if Lynas were to post regular low double digit EOFY profit figures they still need to pull off the whopper $150 million payment due in June 2018 but to be fair if they can meet the production targets and pay off the smaller previous loan installments in full with no delay then the creditors would most likely allow them to spread that large 2018 payment out even further. Hence i reckon its really important for them to show they can service the smaller 2017 amounts with ease.A QR profit of only a couple of million USD will mean they will scrape through to meet the paltry $5 mil December payment and that $15 million June '17 payment could be well and truly a bridge too far let alone the 2018 whopper.So the obvious prudent question is can a company that has posted 5 years of continues losses and last quarter posted a $7 million loss be able to pull off such a feat?so Lynas show us the cheese!!After 5 years of drought bring on this QR report so we can see whether this cow has started producing milk....","Re: Possible Dead Cat Bounce?","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/possible-dead-cat-bounce.2808012/page-30?post_id=18283861","4970","1","16/07/16","00:24:46","7.6¢","None","Not Held"

Twiggy squealed. The federal government should launch an inquiry into iron price volatility! Twiggy demanded. It was a national disgrace that the big boys of the red dirt business were flooding the market making it impossible for the smaller players to compete! Twiggy insisted.Whoops-a-daisy. That’s almost five million tonnes over the 165 MT Twiggy vowed last year he would cap production at in order to stave off further downward pressure on the iron ore price.…And is it a mere coincidence we wonder that the Our Iron Ore website and Facebook page – complete with its evocative photo of a Central Casting miner and his family urging readers to save “Our Families. Our Jobs. Our Future.” – quietly disappeared from the Interweb this past week?No doubt they’re all having a good laugh about those Aussie patsies aboard the good ship billionaire from The Australian:Australia’s Ambassador to the US Joe Hockey has taken time out from his busy schedule to celebrate the 80th birthday of businessman Lindsay Fox.Mr Hockey was snapped in the Mediterranean with mining billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest and actress Deborra Lee-Furness.Mr Fox who turns 80 in April next year is sailing a collection of friends from Athens to Venice to celebrate.

From Jan 16 to now and especially so in the last extension or two they kept hush about any working capital requirement and then throw it out there at the last extension and STILL do not mention NCC. Not one peep of their concern. That they worm out now on these grounds I cannot work out if a) they got cold feet b) we are genuinely to blame 100% but in which case they still never mentioned a peep about this c) the fact that they repeatedly strung us along for so many months and played us well. And played us well they did many here thought this was 99.9% done (haha septa... those words will haunt you) and even I thought this was finally it (that was probably the point everyone should have ran for the hills haha).What makes this more incessant is their parting message that 'oh we'll come back for dessert if it suits us'. Like hell you will!I just hope we have a clear plan going forward to take advantage of the coal price recovering. Getting NCC and an agreement and a 3rd mine (Brakfontein?) will place us miles ahead of the CZA offer if we can pull it off. With UNV management tight lipped I am just not sure which way to lean regarding Eskom? We have some like jono who think it's just in 'paperwork' and my gut feeling where we've been told all sorts of things these last few months by management on both sides ( deal is still progressing  - CZA  directors continue to recommend you accept as they have  - UNV). One would think if UNV really knew they were part way through stuck with paperwork red tape (corporate governance approval)  this would have been communicated with CZA and they would have strove to get the deal over the line (another extension?).Either the UNV board got fed up with them or things aren't as well as they say. all smoke and mirrors and guesing at this stage. Monday i hope we will get some explanations from management.

Until then >80% they have vote control and can de-list the company as its their stated aim of the merge to operate it as a private subsidiary.There are a stack of complex laws about this and there is a bit more info about this on Page 58 of the Bidder's Statement that pretty well states that GXY will not let sleeping dogs lie very comfortably.

Now WPL would not leave anything to chance because multi national companies just don't do that.

How does WPL mitigate these risks? For a start they would sit down with both CNE and FAR and negotiate common ground. CNE we know want to offload 15% of SNE so WPL with its US$1B kitty should be looking at buying that share at a significant premium to the COP deal. With FAR well they have visions of grandeur and are cash strapped. WPL could offer to take a share placement in FAR of 19.9% at 20c as kfann indicated which would raise AUD$184M cash for FAR act as a blocking stake against a T/O of FAR and then offer FAR an additional 5% interest in SNE at the COP sale price of US$62M (AUD$82M) per 5%. Far would end up with $100M cash and an additional 5% of SNE and shareholders would be happy because the dilution is minimal and that still leaves FAR with the diffre block to barter with WPL if the 3D looks promising.","Re: The Deal ...and its just started...","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/the-deal-and-its-just-started.2813186/page-58?post_id=18283984","12758","1","16/07/16","01:44:53","7.7¢","Hold","Held"

After R HaC died and the tilt at BHP didn't work out this guy was cactus careerwise. The establishment took a dim view of their options antics so he became a business analyst. He never convinced me on options it's a risky thing and not available with small outfits like AZS to retail investors...but it did get me thinking.He always said.The examples you give reflect on the importance of management integrity and expertise. You don't need to look far to find some duds and  liars on top of a hole  (a famous answer of Mark Twain to the Q: what is a gold mine?).AZS have burned LT shareholders with- taking quite a while to settle in Mexico  a few mistakes with overconfidence eg. JOGMEC drills finding zip etc.- failed with a manganese production facility (unlucky timing with manganese outlook falling but a great idea to be self funding...instead we got out but burned $1mil or so doing it...never mind. )- issuing CRs at inopportune times and diluting LT holders quite a bit (Tony has said a consolidation isn't a priority right now and I think he might be mindful that for loyal LT shareholders a consolidation before the stock starts really rising can be a slap in the face with a cold fish ...so to speak).AZS :- have cruched some brilliant deals the JV options with majors are great. THIS at a time when exploration stocks were on their knees (many still are!).- Tony as CEO won Explorer of the Year for the Jubilee Mines find and I don't think it was an accident (although the timing in the market for nickel was a very lucky thing! $24 per share was the Xstrata buyout).  Tony has said in an interview he thought he hadin him. While nobody should accept a statement like that as gospel I  had always believed that even before he said it. This is about taking a punt and eliminating the serious negatives and being prepared for the setbacks. You have to go for management quality and Tony and team have proven they're top shelf in expertise and judgement IMO.- had the smarts to go to Mexico where there is high prospectivity and favourable government etc Using Australian expertise combined with the latest technology to revise assumptions go back to mines that have been basically untouched for many years appealed to my simple logic.- had the smarts to use all available resources thoroughly and meticulously going back to old government surveys and drill reports etc They have beenin their approach.- use their brains and don't make assumptions (Oh that old hill? Must be nothing there...nobody has looked at it...etc NO! They think laterally. These are qualities I look for in the management of any stock.  Meanwhile you have to accept that sometimes things happen outside of your control. This is why I've crossed swords with traders in here from time to time.These days the team at AZS are firing on all cylinders IMO. sorry for the blokey talk and the outbreak of exuberance sometimes I post like a bloke because I grew up on a farm with home grown engineers and inventors (eg. they built own hybrid truck using engine from a semi own mobile grain transport container using old bomber wheels invented automated feed systems the govt can't get it together to build a huge silo? heck we'll organise other farmers and assemble it ourselves and they did!) glider flying (eg. funded by building a winch to pull a glider into the air then wind a 2.5km long cable at colossal speed; buying damaged planes and fixing them etc. etc)..  With this in mind I am prepared to wait and forgive undertandable setbacks.I try to see where things are broadly going. And AZS is going to hit some huge spots.

"18284003","ASX - By Stock","http://hotcopper.com.au/discussions/asx---by-stock/","PLS","PLS","Sundreamer","http://hotcopper.com.au/search/search?type=post&users=Sundreamer","27","To clarify this from the 4 July announcement:On the assumption that the JV eventuates without hiccup then the Li chem plant won't come online until mid 2019 at the earliest.The more I think about this plant though the better it sounds to me.  The influence this gives PLS over pricing of Li2CO3 and LiOH could allow PLS time to ramp up spodumene supply without detrimentally affecting the spodumene market. Could it also mean that if the Li chem plant isn't getting enough PLS spodumene that it could be supplied by neighbouring entities such as AJM? Could it mean too that the plant size might if the DFS considers this aspect factor this additional market into consideration? The regional infrastructure will be sufficient / close enough for the neighbours to supply the JV with the necessary spod. Now of course AJM et al ought to have BOAs as well but if the PLS JV with GLC allows for external spodumene then does that not mean that PLS can further control the spodumene market? Does that not mean an additional revenue stream for the JV?We shouldn't forget about PLS' other announcement re LIT's  Li2CO3 process. I know this has been said before but really - this shows how smart PLS is being in mitigating pricing risk - they're looking at multiple ways to not only value add but manage risk through influencing resource pricing vertically.One thing to note - there have been a few comments about how the media has not made a big deal of the JV. I think the reason for this is in the wording of the announcement.  The announcement states:The media seems to have focused on the MOU rather than the word. In the media's defence it doesn't seem like it is all that binding at this stage - it seems more like there is confidence in the goodwill between the 2 parties. Whilst that is an identifiable risk it is also something PLS can develop to the company's advantage. Given the context of the statement I understand why the media has not focused on this element of the announcement as there are a few things that need to be worked out before the plant is up and running.  I don't know anything about GLC but it does seem to me that the PLS management are capable getting this over the line.  Of the little I do know about GLC it seems to me that it is in GLC's best interest to get this over the line too.   Once the JV is up and running PLS shareholders will most likely start talking about how or if the JV is spun off from the 2 entities - but that's an issue for the future I suppose.Taking this further off track from the original post (sorry) - anyone worrying about PLS being undervalued should be looking at why. PLS has grabbed the attention of entities big enough to manipulate a market the way they want. They have established a confidence level of around 62 /63 cents.  That seems to have been affirmed quite clearly of late.  Yes there is the issue of takeover with this 'undervalue' but the upside to this coin is that clearly entities with influence/money see REAL value in PLS. There might be a rinse and repeat in short term trading now but no one should be kidding themselves into thinking there aren't some big entities accumulating who will dictate aprice once PLS goes online.  The players controlling the price at this level are unlikely to be in it for purely short term gain in my opinion. They're vacuuming up the shares they can at this price. In my opinion anyone mad enough to sell at the price we have now is not looking at how this security is trending.  In my mind's eye it can't be the longer term investors selling at this point because we've been bouncing up and down around this price a fair few times. If long term holders wanted to sell I'm pretty sure that they would know they could easily get north of 70c right now.I note whathas said about Greenbush' supply in the future - yet another plus for PLS and the neighbours and thus for the JV's plant.For the short term players / market manipulators the JV(s) and the new plant provide for further PLS announcements and thus of course with every announcement come the usual spikes in trading namely-a) announce the outcome of the 'desktop scoping study of the project' (when this would occur?).  This announcement would likely also include a statement that the JV is going ahead.  I would assume the scoping study would be based upon a definite location of the plant so a statement as to where the plant would be built and who is preparing the feasibility study would also be made. - ie this will be a big statement. We've had our discussion on where the plant will be and I am sticking to my bet on it being built in Vietnam;b) LiChem DFS outcome - another big statement;c) construction of LiChem plant - I would say by that stage this announcement would be on par with announcements relating to the mine itself;d) LiChem plant completed and goes online;e) LiChem commences supply of Li2CO3 and LiOH.How the LIT agreement is affected by this I don't know but if we consider PLS's relationship with LIT we can see there are further announcements coming up-a) ANSTO pilot test work program commences Q3/Q4 2016;b) initial / preliminary results and estimation as to when testing is to be completedc) announcement of formation of JV between LIT and PLS for local (this could be in (b) but if PLS wants to get a reaction from the market it could split the announcements I guess);d) announcement on construction of Li2CO3 plant;e) announcement of initial supply of Li2CO3.Timing for (b) to (e) are up in the air at this stage.So to me there is a dearth of announcements in the next 18 months so that should keep everyone investing in PLS happy (if they're all positive of course). I understand that SuperNinja SOS et al are saying that there needs to be better marketing of PLS - it seems to me that PLS has up until now been purely focused on getting sheet done and don't see the need for plastic wrap marketing. I'm not saying that's a good thing but I can see that they've done a tonne of work to get where they are. The upside to the marketing 'failure' is that retail investors still have an opportunity to get in to PLS at what seems to be a bargain price. For me and in my humble opinion any longer term holder - that isn't too bad a thing.Whilst some HC members here don't like the price manipulation to me because it is predictable it means that there is a sign that PLS can be exploited in several ways and none will be to the long term detriment of the company. It is clear PLS is exposed to a broad range of retail investors through HC and because of the manipulation there seems to be a good amount of interest from the bigger end of town. I agree within that bigger investors are needed in PLS but I think this will come in due course - it would help if PLS marketed itself better but we the retail investors should take advantage of the situation while we can!If you are confident in your understanding of lithium's role in the 4th industrial revolution and PLS' role in the lithium industry then you should be sleeping pretty well - regardless of the short term market. PLS's price is NOT volatile if you do your research and simply read up on this forum (particularly the charting thread to whichhas made a significant contribution).To be clear I'm an enthusiastic novice and no more - I'm not providing an advisory service by subjecting you to this diatribe - I'm just enthusiastic about PLS' future and the role lithium has in the 4th industrial revolution. DYORWith any luck PLS will wait til Tuesday for an announcement because I want to be buying more PLS on Monday's open. What I've seen of late is all positive.","Re: Building Success","http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/building-success.2813405/page-14?post_id=18284003","2776","","16/07/16","02:09:57","62.0¢","Buy","Held"
